      <h2 class="question-title">&gt; How would you introduce yourself and your work to somebody who didn’t know you?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">My name is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/emiliemori/" class="text-link">Émilie Mori</a>, and I create oniric and surrealist photographic compositions, which seek to represent the emotions of <em>dance </em>and <em>femininity</em> through collage and movement.</p>
      <blockquote class="quote left downtitle">i want my images to be impossible to place within the confines of time.</blockquote>
      <p class="paragraph">Initially, I tried to reach this same goal through a more classical <em>illustrative</em> approach; but I couldn’t quite capture a number of things and emotions in the way that I wanted. Photography allowed me to communicate my ideas better.<br><br>I also discovered the art of photographic collage, which I didn’t know, thanks to an artist called <em>Brooke Shaden</em>, and immediately loved it.</p><img src="images/20-red-stole.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 90vw, (max-width: 767px) 70vw, 100vw" srcset="images/20-red-stole-p-500.jpg 500w, images/20-red-stole-p-800.jpg 800w, images/20-red-stole-p-1080.jpg 1080w, images/20-red-stole-p-1600.jpg 1600w, images/20-red-stole.jpg 2010w" alt="" class="blog-image disappear">
      <p class="paragraph">I loved that method because it allowed me to compose images and thoughts within my own head, like a canvas, before actually taking the pictures. I’m not a passive spectator to my work, I like to <em>create</em> and <em>design</em> the images myself; I like journalistic images, but it’s not something I’m interested in myself, from a creative standpoint.</p><img src="images/15-red-stole.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 90vw, 80vw" srcset="images/15-red-stole-p-500.jpg 500w, images/15-red-stole-p-800.jpg 800w, images/15-red-stole-p-1080.jpg 1080w, images/15-red-stole-p-1600.jpg 1600w, images/15-red-stole.jpg 2012w" alt="" class="blog-image full">

      <p class="paragraph">I prefer working with portraits – in fact, I’m very interested in the practice of portraits, especially when the subject is anonymous.<br><br>Of course, there are people within my images, because I love working with people, bodies and faces, even when the face itself is obscured by the model’s hair, or some other thing.<br><br>I’m very interested in human emotions, and I usually like to put people within a larger natural space. <br></p>

      <p class="paragraph">I try to make it easy for the viewer to find him or herself within the image – to project themselves into the image. If the model has a face, whether masculine or feminine, the viewer immediately sees it as someone else; but when subjects have no face, I have the impression that it’s easier for us to imagine that we are indeed within the frame.<br><br>That’s why I usually like to obscure faces, but it’s also because I’m very drawn to this concept of atemporality and timelessness.</p><img src="images/6-red-stole.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 90vw, (max-width: 991px) 60vw, (max-width: 1439px) 300px, 400.0000305175781px" srcset="images/6-red-stole-p-500.jpg 500w, images/6-red-stole-p-800.jpg 800w, images/6-red-stole-p-1080.jpg 1080w, images/6-red-stole-p-1600.jpg 1600w, images/6-red-stole.jpg 2014w" alt="" class="blog-image smaller">
      <p class="paragraph">I want my images to be <em>impossible</em> to place within the confines of time. I don’t want there to be any faces or articles of clothing, decorations, or any other elements that may give up the date of the images.<br><br>I want a viewer from 10 years down the line to be able to see the pictures, without placing them within a single point in time. And sometimes, faces themselves allude to a certain period, a trend, or a style. I want to stay as <em>neutral </em>as possible.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">Years ago, I mainly worked as a graphic designer, but around 2012, I started doing photography as a hobby, without really having the pretension of living off of it. <br><br>But I found so much happiness by doing it, that I started doing it <em>more and more,</em> and it started taking on a bigger and bigger part of my projects, in relation to design.<br><br>There wasn’t any<em> “jump” </em>really to speak of – I just kind of balanced both for the longer part of ten years, focusing more and more on this kind of artistic photography side.<br><br>And as the photography side of my work grew, the design side steadily declined.</p><img src="images/17-la-scrie-noire.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 90vw, (max-width: 767px) 70vw, 100vw" srcset="images/17-la-scrie-noire-p-500.jpg 500w, images/17-la-scrie-noire-p-800.jpg 800w, images/17-la-scrie-noire-p-1080.jpg 1080w, images/17-la-scrie-noire-p-1600.jpg 1600w, images/17-la-scrie-noire-p-2000.jpg 2000w, images/17-la-scrie-noire.jpg 2848w" alt="" class="blog-image disappear">
      <p class="paragraph">And it’s continued to do so, because working as a photographer makes me incredibly happy. It motivates me enormously, and it’s a much more creative and free approach to creation, fatigued as I was from working with businesses, and <em>creative briefs, stakeholder decisions, project limitations</em>, and so on. Working as a photographer allows me to work much more freely, and that has made me, quite simply, just happier overall.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">There are two sides to this. On one side, I find it necessary to say that this happens a lot during my projects; failure is something that happens quite often. And I’m not free of feeling angry sometimes, when a project or an idea doesn’t really work as I wanted it to, but it’s just something that you have to deal with – it happens to everybody, you just need to not take it too personally.</p><img src="images/3-the-shades-of-my-lakes-sky.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 90vw, (max-width: 767px) 70vw, 100vw" srcset="images/3-the-shades-of-my-lakes-sky-p-500.jpg 500w, images/3-the-shades-of-my-lakes-sky-p-800.jpg 800w, images/3-the-shades-of-my-lakes-sky-p-1080.jpg 1080w, images/3-the-shades-of-my-lakes-sky-p-1600.jpg 1600w, images/3-the-shades-of-my-lakes-sky-p-2000.jpg 2000w, images/3-the-shades-of-my-lakes-sky.jpg 2500w" alt="" class="blog-image disappear">
      <p class="paragraph">When you work doing photography, you usually end up throwing away most of the pictures that you take. That’s just part of the experience.<br><br>It can happen to you as well, that you don’t really notice something being <em>off</em> until you sit down for the editing process; and you realize, at that point, that the shooting didn’t really work.<br><br>I’ve lost a lot of work and effort and time because of that, and it can drive you mad sometimes, but it’s not the end of the world, you know.

      <p class="paragraph">But there’s another side to this as well. Sometimes, it’s happened to me, in the midst of a shooting, that I realized that the idea didn’t really <em>work</em>.<br><br>I often don’t feel comfortable saying it out loud to the person that I’m taking pictures of, especially considering that it’s someone that I asked to come with me to the location, take time out of his or her day, and so on.<br><br>I’m not always mature enough to just say, <em>“hey, let’s just cut this, it ain’t working”</em>, right?<em> (laughs).</em> What I usually do in those cases is that I just get it done, put it in a folder somewhere, and forget about it.</p><img src="images/8-current-project.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 90vw, (max-width: 991px) 70vw, (max-width: 1439px) 400.0000305175781px, 500.0000305175781px" srcset="images/8-current-project-p-500.jpg 500w, images/8-current-project-p-800.jpg 800w, images/8-current-project-p-1080.jpg 1080w, images/8-current-project-p-1600.jpg 1600w, images/8-current-project-p-2000.jpg 2000w, images/8-current-project.jpg 2499w" alt="" class="blog-image upping">

      <p class="paragraph">Sometimes, though, I find those projects later down the line – and they end up working <em>beautifully </em>under a different concept. It takes patience in some of these cases, and thankfully, I’m quite a patient person.<br><br>I’ve sometimes worked with pictures that I took over two or three years ago, and they have worked perfectly for current projects.</p>

      <h2 class="question-title">&gt; Let’s finish this with a quick view towards the future. What do you see in your future?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">At the moment, I’m in a bit of a<em> restructuring</em> process of both my activities and services a bit, in a bit more professional manner, because I’d love to work more with bigger brands, to be involved in bigger commercial projects, doing photography.<br><br>I’d love to stop doing design work entirely, and focus completely on my photography, working with brands, but retaining my style. I want to keep working on that towards the end of the year, and for that, I will probably seek some sort of photographic agent.</p><img src="images/Freedom-emiliemori.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 90vw, (max-width: 767px) 70vw, 100vw" srcset="images/Freedom-emiliemori-p-500.jpg 500w, images/Freedom-emiliemori-p-800.jpg 800w, images/Freedom-emiliemori-p-1080.jpg 1080w, images/Freedom-emiliemori-p-1600.jpg 1600w, images/Freedom-emiliemori.jpg 2188w" alt="" class="blog-image disappear">
      <p class="paragraph">That’s one side of it. The other side is that I’m all the while working on three different projects at the moment, which have barely anything to do with each other <em>(laughs).</em> One is a really noir, dark study on bodies, both feminine and masculine, a kind of <em>chiaroscuro</em> work, studying different parts of bodies, nudity, and so on, trying to achieve this look and feel of ancient paintings.<br><br>There’s another one that has to do with a more surrealist, close-up, anonymous subject, closing the camera on small details, parts of the face, mixing different elements in close contact with each other.</p><img src="images/1-hands.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 90vw, (max-width: 3125px) 80vw, 2500px" srcset="images/1-hands-p-500.jpg 500w, images/1-hands-p-800.jpg 800w, images/1-hands-p-1080.jpg 1080w, images/1-hands-p-1600.jpg 1600w, images/1-hands-p-2000.jpg 2000w, images/1-hands.jpg 2500w" alt="" class="blog-image full">
      <p class="paragraph">And finally, there’s a last project that has to do with water, very long stoles, and movement within water. I’ve always wanted to work with water, because I think it gives movement a different <em>weight,</em> a different <em>feel</em>, and I’m always looking forward to new ways of exploring movement.</p><img src="images/1-red-stole.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 90vw, (max-width: 991px) 70vw, (max-width: 1439px) 400.0000305175781px, 500.0000305175781px" srcset="images/1-red-stole-p-500.jpg 500w, images/1-red-stole-p-800.jpg 800w, images/1-red-stole-p-1080.jpg 1080w, images/1-red-stole-p-1600.jpg 1600w, images/1-red-stole.jpg 2018w" alt="" class="blog-image upping">
      <p class="paragraph">So I’m looking forward to all these three projects, and ready for whatever else may come.</p>
