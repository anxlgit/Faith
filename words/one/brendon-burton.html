      <h2 class="question-title">&gt; Nowadays, the social media space seems to be mostly fixated on video content. Has this ever made you question your choice for still photography?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">Aa lot of people have like tried to coerce me into video work, and I think there could have been a lot of potential work if I had pivoted to video – which is like, such a <em>buzzword </em>to say now, <em>“pivoting to video”</em>. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth, just saying it.</p><img src="images/13-north-dakota-2020.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 90vw, (max-width: 767px) 70vw, 100vw" srcset="images/13-north-dakota-2020-p-500.jpg 500w, images/13-north-dakota-2020-p-800.jpg 800w, images/13-north-dakota-2020-p-1080.jpg 1080w, images/13-north-dakota-2020-p-1600.jpg 1600w, images/13-north-dakota-2020.jpg 2000w" alt="" class="blog-image disappear">
      <p class="paragraph">But yeah, I held my ground on photography and stills for two reasons: one of them being that I’m not very good at video. I’m too <em>picky</em>, and I think that there are too many variables with video that I think won’t capture. I think video may be <em>too</em> truthful, in a lot of ways, and I think that’s not what I want my work to be.<br><br>I want my work to be open to interpretation, and I want to keep it a little bit removed from reality. If you give your audience everything, it kind of takes the enjoyment<em> out of it,</em> in a way.<br></p><img src="images/3-north-dakota-2020.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 90vw, 80vw" srcset="images/3-north-dakota-2020-p-500.jpg 500w, images/3-north-dakota-2020-p-800.jpg 800w, images/3-north-dakota-2020-p-1080.jpg 1080w, images/3-north-dakota-2020-p-1600.jpg 1600w, images/3-north-dakota-2020-p-2000.jpg 2000w, images/3-north-dakota-2020-p-2600.jpg 2600w, images/3-north-dakota-2020.jpg 3000w" alt="" class="blog-image full">
      <p class="paragraph">It’s like, I am doing documentary work in a way, but unless I’m shooting for an <em>actual</em> documentary publication, I don’t see the point in being hyper-truthful, I don’t think that’s a requirement. I think that what makes it art in the first place is that the interpretation is varied by everyone.</p><img src="images/28-strange-days.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 90vw, (max-width: 991px) 70vw, (max-width: 1439px) 400.0000305175781px, 500.0000305175781px" srcset="images/28-strange-days-p-500.jpg 500w, images/28-strange-days-p-800.jpg 800w, images/28-strange-days-p-1080.jpg 1080w, images/28-strange-days-p-1600.jpg 1600w, images/28-strange-days-p-2000.jpg 2000w, images/28-strange-days-p-2600.jpg 2600w, images/28-strange-days.jpg 3000w" alt="" class="blog-image upping">
      <p class="paragraph">And the other reason why I haven’t done video is that, I think that the stories that I’m trying to tell, they&#x27;re just <em>better suited</em> for stills.<br><br>I mean, I love cinema, I love film, I love all mediums of visual art, and there’s nothing wrong with video work; and I think there are fantastic people doing fantastic work – but I just think that the subject matter that I’m focused on, and the kind of stories that I’m trying to tell, I feel like I have a lot more minute control, by working with pictures.<br><br>And I think I can kind of structure it to be<em> “everything in one”.</em> I want everything to be seen as a singular thing, and also – it’s more flexible, I guess.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">If I didn’t do it for me, my work wouldn’t be as – I wouldn’t be as happy with it, and it wouldn’t appeal to as many people probably, ironically, because I think that that’s what it is, there’s a small subset of people that say, I <em>like </em>these stories, the macabre, the bizarre, the surreal of it. <br></p>
