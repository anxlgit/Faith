If we’re speaking about somebody that has never heard of user interfaces and user experience, I will just point to the applications on their phone, and tell them that I work on that sort of thing.

      <p class="paragraph">So, yeah, reductionism is just a part of me. And it’s also useful when dealing with clients; because, you know, having options can be both a blessing and a curse.

      <p class="paragraph">That’s also a big reason why I like working in black and white: there are just as many colors as personalities.

      <p class="paragraph">They wanted to hyper-focus their designs and their work on the basics: functionality, simplicity, and order.

So, as you can imagine, the Japanese culture that came out of that was unlike <em>anything else</em> anyone had ever seen.<br><br>In the letter, from whom I think was Walter Gropius, it was written that most of the concepts of modularity, functionality, and efficiency -that the <em>Bauhaus </em>was obsessed over- had already been perfected by the Japanese culture for <em>hundreds </em>of years.</p><img src="images/FmE7zg6aMAINNwx.jpeg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 90vw, (max-width: 991px) 70vw, (max-width: 1439px) 400.0000305175781px, 500.0000305175781px" srcset="images/FmE7zg6aMAINNwx-p-500.jpeg 500w, images/FmE7zg6aMAINNwx-p-800.jpeg 800w, images/FmE7zg6aMAINNwx.jpeg 1200w" alt="" class="blog-image upping">
      <p class="paragraph">And to this day, you can still feel this – working with <em>Sony</em>, which is a relatively new and innovative company in Japan, you can still feel the need to hyper-focus on the details, the <em>hierarchy</em> must always be respected, everything has to be perfect, and so on.<br><br>At the end of the day, culture is nothing but a repetition of <em>method and thought </em>– and Japanese culture is all about precision, elegance, and order.

      <p class="paragraph">It’s been very beneficial to me to think of it in that way, and to focus on doing design as a career, and leave photography as a creative outlet.<br><br>Nowadays I’ve started taking more and more pictures, and improving their quality tremendously over time; not because I intend to sell them, or to turn professional with it, but because I want to become as <em>good</em> a photographer as possible.</p><img src="images/Maasa072023.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 90vw, (max-width: 767px) 70vw, 100vw" srcset="images/Maasa072023-p-500.jpg 500w, images/Maasa072023-p-800.jpg 800w, images/Maasa072023.jpg 1000w" alt="" class="blog-image disappear">
      <p class="paragraph">When I went into art school, and started taking pictures, and developing them – I don’t know if you know this, but revealing black and white pictures is a very involved process – you can play with the exposition by letting the images rest within the lab process, so you can play with lights and shadows with that, and focus, and contrast, brightness, and so on.<br><br>I loved that process, it absolutely bewitched me, because I saw that even without color, there’s so much that you can express within a single picture.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">I guess you’re talking about <em>BLACK</em>. Well, at some point I thought that, if working as a photographer was not to become a goal, I should find a way to still work with photography, in some way.<br><br>So I got the idea of developing an <em>App </em>for phone photography, because at around the time of its development, I was using a <em>Nokia</em> phone with quite a nice, 40Mpx camera, and I had fun taking pictures with it, but I wanted to be able to make them in black and white, and to use the analog filters that I loved from other apps.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">Long story short, I got together with a work colleague, and developed quite an interesting interface, stripped of anything unnecessary – unobtrusive, reductionist, just like, <em>gesture-based</em>, reducing the number of interactions and touches to the absolute bare minimum.<br><br>I wanted to build a product that could be used 10, 20, 50 years from now; are we not using much older cameras nowadays?<br><br>So, yeah, we shipped it to <em>Windows Phone</em>, it kind of blew up, <em>Windows</em> wrote to us, featured the App, and so on.

      <p class="paragraph">Unfortunately, this past May, after 10 years, we ended up discontinuing the project; but the results, with over 2 million downloads, were astonishing. And I think it all came down to that idea of working towards a design that could be <em>timeless</em>.<br><br>I despise trends and tendencies and fashion, I don’t care if we’re talking about cars, or brands, or whatever. That’s why I love such philosophies as that from the <em>Ulm School of Design</em>, where they tried to reduce things to their bare essentials: a chair should have three legs, because if you remove one more, it <em>falls.</em></p>
