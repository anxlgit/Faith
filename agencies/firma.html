  <section class="centered">
    <p>My name is Fernando Palacios, and I'm a producer, graphic designer & polyglot from Zaragoza.</p> <p>I'm writing to you because I saw that you're looking for an assistant producer, and I may be a good fit.</p>

    <img src="../media/authorhz.png">
    <p>To date, I've worked as a project director and guest manager for an international short film festival (leading a team of over 20 coworkers), and self-produced two different environmental documentaries (one of which is actually being shot, covering the death of glaciers). Both have been developed without grants or outside aid, and carried to completion on sheer passion and resourcefullness.</p>
    <p>I've also done hundreds of interviews, in different languages, to agents of all backgrounds and countries imaginable – and covered a multitude of roles, from copywriter with businesses from India and Denmark, to barista in one of my city's preppiest cafés.</p>
    <p>That equals to me saying that I'd be pumped to work with you – I'm always about pushing projects forward, and have a long background in working with international teams, be it from top or bottom. I've also been working in customer-faced roles for a big chunk of my career, so I'm used to loosening tensions and adapting quickly to the unpredictable stuff that may (and will) pop up.</p>
    <p>A number of years ago, I also decided to learn the 10 most widely spoken languages in the world (plus some other personal choices). At the moment, I'm capable of speaking English, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese and German (perfect for greeting visitors and guests) and I'm working in improving my Japanese and Russian, while having some basic knowledge of Arabic, Chinese and Hindi.</p>

    <p>The principal reason for my interest in your work comes by way of your profoundly polished approach to strategic design, which is one of the ways in which I'd like to grow professionally over the next couple of years. I'm a designer myself, and I'd love to be close to those that are making a killing.</p>
    <p>Plus, your Barcelona offices are just cool as hell.</p>
