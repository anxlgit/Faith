  <h1 class="presentation visible">Hi people at Firma!<br><br>↓</h1>

  <section class="centered">
    <p>My name is Fernando Palacios, and I'm a project manager, visual designer & polyglot from Zaragoza.</p> <p>I'm writing to you because I saw that you're looking for an administrative assistant, and I may be a good fit.</p>

    <p>To date, I've worked as a project director and guest manager for an international short film festival (leading a team of over 20 coworkers), and produced two different environmental documentaries (one of which is actually being shot, covering the death of glaciers). Both have been developed without grants or outside aid, and carried to completion on sheer passion and resourcefullness.</p>
    <p>I've also done hundreds of interviews, in different languages, to agents of all backgrounds and countries imaginable – and covered a multitude of roles, from copywriter with businesses from India and Denmark, to barista in one of my city's preppiest cafés.</p>
    <p>That equals to me saying that I'd be pumped to work with you – I'm always about pushing projects forward, and have a long background in working with international teams, be it from top or bottom. I've also been working in customer-faced roles for a big chunk of my career, so I'm used to loosening tensions and adapting quickly to the unpredictable stuff that may (and will) pop up.</p>
    <p>A number of years ago, I also decided to learn the 10 most widely spoken languages in the world (plus some other personal choices). At the moment, I'm capable of speaking English, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese and German (perfect for greeting visitors and guests) and I'm working in improving my Japanese and Russian, while having some basic knowledge of Arabic, Chinese and Hindi.</p>

    <p>These are the problems that I could solve:</p> <hr> <p><em>General care of the office (I'm a proud perfectionist and method nerd) and overall tidyness of the space, always ready to kick into full gear.</em></p> <p><em>Team communications between different agents and groups, ensuring clear messages are sent and received, with translation to native languages (if necessary).</em></p> <p><em>Assistance in production or project management, wherever it's needed, or general knowledge of the process.</em></p> <p><em>Guest and call management, in as many as six languages, and constant follow-up to the client's or team's demands.</em></p> <p><em>And of course, any and all cultural chat, free of charge. I've read and listened and played and visited almost all cultural media that I've encountered (and made some myself).</em></p><hr>

    <p>The principal reason for my interest in your work comes by way of your profoundly polished approach to strategic design, which is one of the ways in which I'd like to grow professionally over the next couple of years. I'm a designer myself, on my free time, and I'd love to be close to those that are making a killing.</p>
    <p>Plus, your Barcelona offices are just cool as hell. I went there (and gave you a little white business card, cotton paper, face on the front?) some months ago, and came out just mesmerized by what I saw. Barcelona as well is a place that I've always wanted to live in – and that's coming from someone who's gone through Athens, Sofia and Istambul.</p>
