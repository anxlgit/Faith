  <h1 class="presentation visible">Hi people at Folch!<br><br>↓</h1>

  <section class="centered">
    <p>My name is Fernando Palacios, and I'm a project manager, visual designer & polyglot from Zaragoza.</p> <p>I'm writing to you because I think you're one of the best references out there for strategic and narrative design, and I'd like to work with you.</p>

    <h2 class="smallcaps">who am i:</h2>
    <img src="../media/authorhz.png">
    <p>To date, I've worked as a project director for an international short film festival (leading a team of over 20 coworkers), and produced two different environmental documentaries (one of which is actually being shot, covering the death of glaciers).</p>
    <p>I've also done hundreds of interviews, in different languages, to agents of all backgrounds imaginable – and covered a multitude of roles, from copywriter with businesses from India and Denmark, to barista in one of my city's preppiest cafés.</p>
    <p>A number of years ago, I also decided to learn the 10 most widely spoken languages in the world (plus some other personal choices). At the moment, I'm capable of speaking English, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese and German, and I'm working in improving my Japanese and Russian, while having some basic knowledge of Arabic, Chinese and Hindi.</p>

    <p>My services as part of your team could fulfill four of your needs:</p> <hr> <p><em>Production of video materials or shorts, for any of your clients or projects.</em></p> <p><em>Visual design, both in its graphical, aesthetic, and structural aspects.</em></p> <p><em>Project management, regarding deliveries, materials, cooperation, and deadlines.</em></p> <p><em>And lastly, field research, through the development of interviews focused on the generation of insights and customer maps.</em></p> <hr>

    <h2 class="smallcaps">what do i seek:</h2>
    <img src="../media/tower.jpg">
    <p>The principal reason for my interest in your work comes by way of your profoundly polished approach to brand & narrative design, which is one of the ways in which I'd like to grow professionally over the next couple of years.</p>
    <p>I'd love to collaborate in projects like the ones that you did with Odiseo and Eldorado – projects that go beyond mere aesthetics, where the souls of brands, their purposes and missions, are made tangible in their designs and implemented through their later work.</p>
