<p>Come hither, child, said she. And do not wonder – for all is brave, when all is done. She became ready – but wait, he said. I have a story. I have to ponder, he said, if thee want it told?</p>
<p>She was enthused, and curious. She wanted more. So tell thy story, she said, but make it quick, be sure in so – for night is calling, and lights go low.</p>

<p>Say why, then, thy paths are over, thy strength undone? I wonder: thy skies so closed, thy eyes so low?</p>
<p>I have been other, said he: I was not this, but different. I wandered then, was alive, was frowned by the current, and thrust upon. I watched it all, done it all – became cats, and noises, and sounds, and waterfalls. I went through every crevice, explored every hole.</p>
<p>Then I was younger, still, and also braver, still. I was not bent then, I was ready, had not been crossed then, had not been torn. But all rocks fought me, winds carved my bones. I was so different, then, than I become.</p>

<p>But how so happened, said she, how thee went numb? How this world broke thee, how life went so?</p>
<p>It was a man, said he, so proud and tall. He was in wholeness, so were his movements, his flamings, his smoke. It was his sunrise, his smiling, his touch. It became biggest – became my all.</p>
<p>His sides became my world, his fury storms. His sights my wordings, his shoulders pure ore. In all those days that followed, I followed him. I did not stop. I did not wonder, then, how I grew old. I just did so, in all those manners, without a stop.</p>
<p>But one day he was gone, he said, and was no more.</p>
<p><img src="../media/posts/storms/storms3.jpg" alt="toffee maky"></p>
<p>And who was this man -asked her, eager- that could be so? Who could have broke you, have you so done?</p>
<p>I did not know then, said he, I know now not. I never asked it. He never told. His name was nothing, his warmth was all. His life was endless, his line all round. His lights were spotless, his dark all gone.</p>
<p>He governed all times then – he drove them on. He announced all mornings, closed all evenings, and so on. His dawn was everything – still is so. Would you care, he said so, finally, a full smile on, to meet him now?</p>

<p>And then it happened: the sun then shone. She noticed then, how she&#39;d been tricked. How all had gone. And thus she laughed, and quietly vanished.</p>
<p>And he – lived on.</p>
