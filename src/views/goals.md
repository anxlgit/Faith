# Goals

So my goals are to seek these, and to pierce them into existence, to make them concrete. In short, I hope to write them, for these views are to me like writings themselves, or at the very least,  as windows into different realities.

In the process of creating a written record, it may ease others into them, into their opennings – impossible and different. The path will entail the use of multiple and diverse metaphorae, amongst them my own, in their transference to the digital rivers.

The results will vary. I hope that some are good.

Not all wrongs are useless, after all. History has endulged in allowing us to commit the same mistakes, over and over, in the hopes of realizing our shortcomings. In stories, we find a confirmation about humanity.

In stories, we find our own worries and mistakes in the shape of the worries and mistakes of others. In that way, stories are useful. Hence, in the written word, these windows may become perspectives akin or similar to those we know.

These are my intentions. May these serve as a refuge for winters and wind.

Please indulge the mistakes that be.
