     <p class="first">_ Oh, don't stop. Play on, please.</p>
     <p>_ There's a price: a place on your ship.</p>
     <p>_ (…) What do you know of the sea? (thunder)</p>
     <p>_ Nothing.</p>
     <p>_ To face the sea without knowledge or skill – brings only death.</p>
     <p>_ Of death I am knowledgeable. Danger I do not fear – and I can give you music.
       Music that will tame wild beasts, lift men’s hearts to heaven.</p>
     <p>_ What is your name?</p>
     <p>_ Orpheus.</p>

   <section class="explanation">
     <p>This project is an exploration from <a href="https://ferpalacios.xyz" target="blank">Studio Anxl</a> on the possibilities
     of online publishing.</p>
     <p> The current edition seeks to explore the possibilites of combining audio recordings
     with a fairly direct, unfiltered editorial transcription.</p>
     <p>The concept followed the idea of collecting a variety of voices,
       presenting them -as is- (with minimal editorial alterations).</p>
     <p>The resulting style of the texts may take an unpolished appearance, as with any
       prototype, for the concept wanted to preserve the idioms of talk.</p>
     <p>The author is greatly thankful to all of the featured interviewees on this
       prototype, as well as to those who did not leave the cutting floor.</p>
