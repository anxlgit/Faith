   <img class="heroimg" src="profiles/benpacker.jpeg" alt="ben packer">

  <p>I am <a href="https://www.benpacker.xyz/" target="_blank">Benjamin Packer</a>, [and] I am Australian, grew up in Australia, but for
  the last 4 years I have been Berlin-based – working as a colorist, freelance
  colorist, mostly in film, music videos, TV commercials.</p>

  <p>And for people that may not be aware of what colorist is, I describe it in a
  couple of ways; the most simplified version, that’s kind of easy for people to
  understand, is that I create highly customized Instagram filters (laughs) and
  then it builds from there, it gets much more specific.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2 onclick="audioTime(1,09)">How would you describe what a colourist does, and how did you become one?</h2>

  <p>Yeah so I mean (...) when I tell people that I'm a colourist, a lot of people do
  not know that the job exists. It was the same for me – in high school actually
  what I wanted to be was a mix engineer, audio engineer, and during high school I
  was doing some kind of community radio broadcasting, and that was my way into
  media.</p>

  <p>From high school, I wanted to continue it, and to study audio engineering and
  mix engineering at University but, because I didn't have the kind of musical
  training that I needed to get into the music conservatory, I applied for a media
  degree instead – I said, <em>"media is close enough, right? I'll do all my music as
  University electives, and I can maybe get into it that way"</em>.</p>

  <p>So when I was studying, I did a placement as part of my studies in a studio,
  and I was working as a sound editor or sound assistant there, and was spending
  most of my time with the main engineer – and he would say <em>"can you go and find
  some sound effects of a middle-aged woman wearing high heels, walking on gravel"</em>,
  and I would search through the library to find that specific sound.</p>

  <p>After working for that company for a couple of weeks, there was some nice
  connection there and they offered me the possibility to keep working with them
  on weekends in a live sound environment, so I was doing kind of live <em>PA</em>
  [Production Assistance] with live sporting events broadcasting. I did that for
  maybe a year, year-and-a-half, and there was a lot of -because it was sports
  broadcast- a lot of crossover between the audio side of things and the picture
  broadcasting, so I got to know some of the picture team.</p>

  <p>And then, as my studies came to an end I was offered more work during the
  week, cause previously I was only doing weekend work, and I joined their machine
  room team. I was basically an assistant for them, working with the tapes,
  because they were still shooting on tape at the time, so tapes would come into
  the studio and it was my job to digitize them, or if they had finished the
  production, and they were delivering master tapes, it was my job to lay them out
  to do the <em>QC</em> [Quality Control] checks.</p>

  <p>It was working at that company where I first came across color – because
  right down the hall from where the main audio studio was, there
  [was] the color grading studio.</p>

  <h3 class="quote">What is this dark room with a crazy control panel and a projector
    shooting images onto the wall? I thought, that's cool – I wonder what
    happens here.</h3>

  <p>So yeah, I ended up working for that company for almost five years I think,
  from when I had first started in the sound department, until I eventually left.
  I worked my way up from being the machine room assistant, to being the assistant
  editor; I did some editing of my own for a little while, and then moved into
  online editing and visual effects, compositing work for commercials.</p>

  <p>And my, the boss of the company was the lead colorist and <em>VFX</em> supervisor; and
  he taught me quite a bit, I was kind of coming up underneath him, but the size
  of the market where I was, and my desire to learn more, and his schedules, kind of
  weren't quite working out – so I was looking to develop further, and then that
  is how I ended up in Berlin.</p>

  <p>I found a specialized education program, that was run for a number of years
  in Berlin; they had a selection process where they only selected 10 students per
  year, and of those 10 students, I took one of the two spot for non-European citizens.
  So me, being Australian, I was quite lucky to even get into the program.</p>

  <p>Basically, once I was selected, I told my boss, <em>"look, I'm going to go Berlin,
  to do the study program"</em>, and basically sold all of my stuff in Australia, and
  packed it all away and moved to Berlin -the original plan was to stay 9 to 10
  months-, and I did the program, and at the end of the program (…) I thought that
  I would move to the UK for a while, there's quite a busy industry in the UK, so
  I went there for a month and a half, two months.</p>

  <p>But it wasn't quite my scene, as a small town kid from Australia to a
  big city; it was a bit overwhelming <em>(laughs)</em> – luckily I found another
  position back in Berlin, and I ended up coming back to Berlin, worked in a
  company for a couple of years; and for the last year and a half, I've just been
  a freelance.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2 onclick="audioTime(6,44)">At which stage of project production do you usually get involved?</h2>

  <p>Yeah I mean, it depends on the project. For example, a lot of music videos
  and commercials that I'm involved with, because of the schedules, they don't
  usually have time to develop a <em>"look"</em> or any kind of grading ideas upfront;
  but a lot of the nicer projects that I have been involved with, with short films
  for example, I try to get involved as early as possible.</p>

  <p>I am actually not usually too involved during the shoot, but during
  pre-production, I will try to get involved with the <em>DP</em> [Director of Photography]
  and the director of the
  art department, and when they're doing camera test lens test, testing production
  design, and costume test, makeup tests, I will usually try to be involved in
  that stage, so we can really start to craft an idea of where a project would
  like to go.</p>

  <p>And then I can build, I try to build a very barebones, flexible variation of
  the kind of ideas that we we are all thinking about – so that when everybody's
  looking at a monitor, they're actually looking at something that is close to the
  final product.</p>

  <p>And that usually means that you can start the work earlier, and you can start
  designing a world, and a look, and a mood to the project; that means that when
  we get to the end, you've actually already done a lot of the hard work, or the
  big creative task of coming up with this mood, and [the] feeling is already there.</p>

  <p>And then you really get to spend all
  of you all the time finessing it, and really getting into the details and
  getting it getting closer and closer to perfection.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2 onclick="audioTime(8,42)">What particular value would you say coloring brings to projects?</h2>

  <p>I think – it might be kind of controversial, but I think that the value that
  color can bring to a project has more to do with the value that people see in
  it.</p>

  <p>You mentioned at the start [that], talking about color is really
  something that is difficult to do, there is no – I mean there are ways to
  measure color, and to have standards about color, but when you and I talk about
  the color <em>“red"</em>, the image that you have in your mind of the color red is
  probably different to the image that I have in my mind.</p>

  <p>We're going to be thinking of different shades, and a big part of
  working together with other creatives, because usually the coloring process is
  very collaborative, it's actually about kind of building, building the language
  and getting some kind of understanding of the other person's sense of color.</p>

  <p>And you really, for every project you really kind of have to spend some time
  with the person to understand how did they see, how do they think, what does it
  mean when they say they want something darker: do they want it to actually be
  physically darker, or do they want the <em>"mood"</em> to be darker?</p>

  <img src="img/benboxer.jpg" alt="boxing">

  <p>So yeah, there is, there's a lot that's open to interpretation (…) when
  somebody is really considerate to the grading process, it just means that that's
  something that they are also really taking into consideration themselves, and
  that they kind of have to have a little bit of understanding of the power
  themselves of the mood that they can bring through it.</p>

  <p>I mean, I can always bring some kind of mood myself to a project, and also
  part of the process is that I make suggestions based on what I think is
  appropriate, based on what I've seen; but for most projects, if the creativity
  is in there, you can usually, at least for me, by now I can usually just look at
  a project and say, <em>"okay, it's been shot in a certain way, there are certain
  stylistic decisions that are here, framing and storytelling"</em>, you know, so
  there's a particular style that would be really nice on the project.</p>

  <p>And you can kind of see it and bring that out; but at the same time, you
  still have to have the understanding with the other creatives to be able to talk
  about it to bring that out. Yeah, it's just another tool that you can use in
  order to bring emotion and mood to something.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2 onclick="audioTime(11,46)">Do you think colouring should be more respected within the industry?</h2>

  <p>It definitely helps to have an understanding of what is possible with
  the tools that are around. But yeah, I also see – the grading should definitely be
  a supporting role; I won't be able to get the quote, right, but Dave Hussey
  I believe said it; he's quite a well-known colorist that works at <em>Company 3</em>,
  one of the largest companies in the industry.</p>

  <p>He has a quote that is something like, along the lines of: <em>"we work really
  really hard to make sure you don't see what we do"</em>. You want to be able to feel
  it, you want to be able to be aware of it, but you don't want your attention to
  be drawn to it.</p>

  <p>So it is definitely a supporting role, because there are plenty of films out
  there that are not graded very well, but the story and the emotions that are in
  them [are] great. And so if we're going the other way, if you get a story that's
  rubbish it's just a boring story, there's nothing interesting about it, it
  doesn't really matter how beautiful it is <em>(laughs)</em>, because nobody is going to
  care.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2 onclick="audioTime(12,58)">How do you see coloring techniques or technologies evolving in the future?</h2>

  <p>There are certainly some kind of like, trends, that happen during the years,
  with different productions. I think at the moment, the way the industry is
  going, it's kind of in a period of re-discovery, so that's kind of the general
  history of color grading, it started back when it was color-timing, and it
  was really just shining lights onto film strips and processing it that way.</p>

  <p>Then eventually we got the ability to scan from film into a computer, and to
  be able to make some adjustments there; but it would still need to be printed
  out to a film again, so you were still kind of limited in what you're able to
  do.</p>

  <p>And then we got digital projection, and we kind of went into digital cameras:
  that was also a period where there was some more kind of experimentation, and
  people are still understanding that technology. So at the moment, we're going
  through another period of discovery, because the technology is moving away from
  the standard projection formats that we've been used to.</p>

  <img src="img/bencolor.jpg" alt="color">

  <p>Previously, if you were creating a feature film, you would be, no doubt,
  working around the main master version. And everybody would go and see what
  would be the cinema version, and you would have to go and sit in a dark room,
  watch it being projected from a projector onto a white wall, at <em>48 nits</em>, or
  <em>44 lamberts</em>, depending on which system you use.</p>

  <p>And that was the standard, that's what everybody was going to watch. But now
  that we have new platforms for consuming, most people are shifting to the
  streaming services, they're shifting to mobile devices or whatever the
  technology that's available that you actually view the content on is
  different.</p>

  <p>In most situations now, instead of looking at a projection with a low
  luminance, you're looking at it some kind of screen, with a much brighter output
  – mobile screens have HDR mode, so the range of contrast that you're able to
  display between black and white is a lot larger, and because we're moving into
  this kind of different technology, that [allows for] a different experience.</p>

  <p>I think
  that a lot of people are still discovering what is possible with the new medium,
  because now we're shifting away from the main version being a cinema projection
  to actually perhaps the main version is the Netflix version the people going to
  see on the TV at home.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2 onclick="audioTime(15,56)">Could you led me through your coloring process?</h2>

  <p>I actually see my work as a contrast of three things: it's more like a
  triangle that I move within. There's the technical, scientific background of it,
  which is really about understanding quite deeply the process of what is
  physically happening; and that can be an understanding of lenses, and why light
  reacts a certain way through lenses, or why there are blurs or flares, or the
  technical process of <em>1s</em> and <em>0s</em> that [run inside] computers, why it happens that
  way.</p>

  <p>And I think understanding that, and understanding why something happens, is
  what gives me the ability to be creative; because once you start to understand
  the technical side of it, you can say <em>"okay, look, this is the correct way"</em>, airquotes,
  <em>"of you
  being able to do something, and creating something"</em>, [and then] when you understand the process,
  you can go into
  any kind of step of the process and make [intentional] mistakes.</p>

  <p>As technology advances, we are getting closer and closer to perfect images,
  and having everything really replicating exactly what has happened on set, and
  being very clean. But the process of filmmaking is often about the kind of happy
  accidents that happen along the way: shooting on film, analog film for example,
  you don't actually represent 1 to 1 what you see in the world, it adds a kind of
  <em>“character”</em>.</p>

  <img src="img/benstrand.png" alt="beach">

  <p>It’s the same for the cameras and lenses that you use; they have their own
  kind of flavor, and being able to understand what they do (...) you can provide this
  kind of creativity. In the past, we might have had to use [certain] lenses, or
  shoot on a [certain] film, but now we've got the ability to take some kind of
  filtration idea, and pair it with a digital thing that hasn't ever really being
  combined before.</p>

  <p>(…) But then the third part of the
  triangle is the personal side of things, so being able to relate to other people
  and being able to communicate with them, and understand, yeah, if they like
  something or if they don't like something.</p>

  <p>A lot of the times with projects, I had one recently where actually a lot of
  my time and effort in the grading session was not spent grading, it was
  actually spent a little bit more as the therapist at the end of the project.</p>

  <p>Because it had been quite a long process and your – your job as the colorist,
    you've got one week or two weeks, at the end of the project, to make
  sure that this person is happy with their work and their results, and it's
  something that they can take away with them and present to the world.</p>

  <p>And often times, when you're sitting in the dark room together for a week,
  that's their chance to be able to vent out, or to be able to talk about
  everything that went wrong during the project. And you can try to fix some
  things, some things you just can't fix, and you just going to have to help them
  through the processing, and get to the end result eventually.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2 onclick="audioTime(19,41)">What is your take on these new lighting technologies,
    such as LED walls?</h2>

  <p>I think that <em>LED</em> walls and all are very nice
  tools to have – I personally have only worked on one project that was shot with
  an LED wall, and at least the issue that I had with that project was that it was
  quite difficult to find the right balance between the foreground live-action set
  that is in the studio, being lit with a correct ratio for the wall in the
  background, which is emitting light.</p>

  <p>You can somehow still sense that the wall is a light-emitting surface, once
  it's been shot, which is not a sensation that you have when you just put, take a
  camera out and point it at a tree outside; you don't have the impression that
  the tree is glowing <em>(laughs)</em>.</p>

  <p>But somehow, when you put the same image of a tree on an LED wall, your brain
  just kind of knows that it is illuminated. Yeah, it's at the moment, that's kind
  of [the latest] uncanny valley thing, that still needs to be worked out.</p>

  <p>The speed of research is very interesting because, I don't have the exact
  numbers, but I was having a conversation with some other colorist a while ago where
  (…) he had done some calculations, he basically looked at Kodak who had been the
  major image research body for about a hundred years, through producing analog
  film.</p>

  <p>And and he calculated roughly, let's say, that there was 15, 20 top scientist
  at Kodak over a hundred years – so he calculated out how many hours of research
  and development they would have put into understanding images, getting their
  image science to the level that it was, before they themselves came up with
  digital sensors and shot themselves in the foot (laugh).</p>

  <p>By his calculations (…) Apple is able to do about twice the amount of hours
  that Kodak had done in their lifetime, they can do that in about a year, because
  they have devices everywhere, that are actually able to give feedback, and
  they're able to actually collect the feedback on the process – whereas Kodak was
  a very one-way straight [process], they would do their research and we put it out
  there, and maybe get some feedback.</p>

  <h3 class="quote">The power of the devices and just the amount of data that [new companies] are able
  to generate, collect and then refine, makes the speed of research and
  development we're at right now just incredible, compared to what we had.</h3>

  <p>And
  that's still talking about just one company (...) but then you can also add the same
  kind of manpower from companies like Samsung and Sony. So I think generally,
  the computing power is going to accelerate very very
  quickly, but I think that it will become, I just think it's probably going to
  end up being more and more important to understand the process.</p>

  <p> Because as we
  get a more complicated process, and a more perfect process, being able to know
  where to dive into the system in order to break things in a nice creative way,
  that gives some kind of different effect, and different results, instead of just
  kind of breaking it and then the system doesn't work – that’s going to be quite
  important, to really understand from A to Z, all the steps that are in between,
  and really what the general process is hiding in it in order to be able to tweak
  them.</p>

  <p><em>(recording problems)</em></p>

  <p>Yeah I think that's probably what it is, I have been for probably for a year,
  or so now, I’ve been getting into creating some of my own tools – I'm not much of
  a coder, but I'm trying to teach myself some kind of code so that I can give
  myself the ability to get into the system and to be able to break it in a way
  that I want to. I think that's a really, it's an interesting direction for me to
  go into.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2 onclick="audioTime(25,21)">Have you ever dived into the more technical aspects of coloring software?</h2>

  <p>(...) Like I said, I’m not much of a coder myself, but you could still go
  and get a bunch of different packages and not actually understand how any of the
  packages work, hack them together into something that fulfills the purpose that
  you want, and achieve the task.</p>

  <p>But I think if you don’t really understand how each of the parts are working,
  then at some point you’re kind of losing a little bit of control along the way,
  which is fine, sometimes you don’t need to know the full depth of a package but
  – yeah, it’s really, going through the process and then just ending like, okay,
  maybe I don’t need to know so much about this, I can just let that be <em>(laughs)</em>,
  to let it do its thing on its own.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2 onclick="audioTime(26,27)">What is your favourite part of taking part on different projects?</h2>

  <p>I think it's really nice to be able to go and find somebody that you can
  really kind of collaborate with, and learn from.</p>

  <p>Don’t be afraid of collaborating with many people; I think that's that's
  probably the nice part about of what I do is, is that there is no correct way
  of actually grading, it's really about kind of meeting different people and
  finding out what they want, learning from each other, and going through that
  process of pulling stuff apart and putting it back together again.</p>

  <p>Because yeah, two different people will have different results from the same
  ingredients. Actually one of the nicest – when I was studying, one of the nicest
  exercises that we did was [one where] had a speed challenge type exercise, where we were
  given some material; I think it was a 4-minute long music video or something,
  and we were given 3 hours to work on it, from start to finish and delivery, to
  just sit down, grade it, deliver it and be done.</p>

  <p>And so, because the time frame is limited, you're left to quite a lot of your
  own understanding of what the project is, or its creative interpretation. And
  all of us, all came out with 10 different results, even though it's the same
  material, using the same equipment – I think a lot of that difference is, I think
  came from people's interpretation of how they see something.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2 onclick="audioTime(28,28)">You used to regularly post "just make" on social media from time to time.
    What was the reasoning behind that?</h2>

  <p><em>"Just make"</em>, <em>"just make"</em>. I only have one tattoo, and it's [that],
    tattooed on my chest. The whole <em>"just
  make"</em> thing, it's kind of fallen a little bit by the wayside lately, but
  eventually I would like to get it back. It basically started when I was still in
  Australia, I was part of a group and we were trying to (…) just do something,
  just make it, and finish it, and then once it's finished, then you've learned
  everything that you're going to learn from it, and then that allows you to take
  your next step.</p>

  <p>For the group of us it was really, we were a whole bunch of different
  creatives, we were developers, photographers, directors, editors, accountants,
  and it was a real mix of different people, and it was just, every two weeks, we
  would have some kind of themed challenge.</p>

  <p>And the idea wasn't necessarily like <em>"this needs to be amazing"</em>, it was just
  like <em>"let's make something, and then we'll have the chance to talk about it,
  learn from each other, and then we'll move on to the next one”</em>.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2 onclick="audioTime(29,49)">Has that perspective and experience affected your work as a colorist?</h2>

  <p>It changed my personal approach to how I grade as well (...) when I started out,
    I would land on a shot and think <em>"okay, how do I make
  this short a perfect shot"</em>, and then I would start working and working and
  working [on it], and then go to the next.</p>

  <p>But now, I’m very much – I start with a much wider picture, and I can then go
  through and get everything working similarly, and working in balance, and then I
  start refining, and start getting down to more and more details, [so] it
  becomes like <em>“just do it"</em>, and then watch it again, and then the next time (…) it starts
  getting better the more you watch it.</p>

  <p>You also need the flow of context when you’re grading too, you need to see
  what has happened before, what is going to happen next, and how everything
  connects; if you end up spending too much time, focused on one
  little shot and making sure that that one thing is perfect, you start to lose context.</p>

  <p>And there have been times when, when you step back, you realize you spent
  ages in one shot, and think ok, that one looks great, but everything else around it now
  looks terrible.</p>
