   <h1>A Naturallistic Fallacy</h1>

   <img class="heroimg" src="profiles/mikanaylor.jpeg" alt="mikanaylor">

    <p>[I'm <a href="https://autophagy.io/" target="_blank">Mika</a>]; I'm professionally a software engineer,
      and that's kind of
    what I tend to also do a lot in my personal time, mostly because I like
    software engineering as a creative output – I really like
    the ways in which you can kind of like pick up different things and
    different ways of thinking about like both human-computer interaction
    problems, but also like visual problems.</p>

    <p>And I can pick up things from other people and kind of like, incorporate
    them into [my] own kind of toolset, for solving open problems – and I kind of
    I guess I characterize my role as a toolmaker. I like making mostly
    programming tools, but I have made a few kind of in real-life tools, so to
    say.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2 onclick="audioTime(1,08)">You've been a very vocal advocate of <em>"functional programming"</em>. Could you
    explain what that is?</h2>

    <p>Within kind of like, the programming world, people kind of
    use different <em>"paradigms"</em> I guess, maybe is the right word? To structure
    not only the code that they write, but the way they think about the problems
    they're trying to solve, and the approach that they take for it.</p>

    <p>A very common one is called <em>"object-oriented programming"</em>, in which you
    model the problem that you're trying to solve by breaking it down into
    <em>"classes"</em>, which are kind of like descriptions or outlines of <em>"entities"</em>, and
    concrete instantiations of those entities – that have both a public
    interface, and private components, or private information that they only
    expose through that public interface.</p>

    <p>And then you model your programs to solve those problems as interactions
    between these <em>"instantiated"</em> objects, as it were. And that's quite a dominant
    paradigm.</p>

    <p>One that’s kind of less dominant, but is still quite interesting, is one
    that you already mentioned, which is called <em>"functional programming"</em>, in
    which the problem that you're attempting to solve – you don't muddle it as a
    set of objects interacting with each other, but you essentially model it as a
    <em>"function"</em>, which -to put kind of like a quick spin on it-, is something that
    takes a set of inputs and maps that to a set of outputs.</p>

    <p>Take for example the <em>"add"</em> function: it might take two inputs from the
    set of say integers, and map that to a single output in a set of integers.
    And so the way in which you model these computational problems, in
    functional programming, is that you model them as functions that act on sets
    on data, that tend to transform them or return data or do something like
    that, and then you compose all those functions into essentially one giant
    expression, and that is your program.</p>

    <img src="img/mikamap.jpeg" alt="mika map website">

    <p>This way of thinking about it allows for a lot of kind of programming
    tricks, that are quite difficult to do in another paradigms. For example
    like, <em>"composability"</em>, I really like – which is when you take functions that
    have specific <em>"functions"</em> I guess, for the lack of a better word,
    and you can link them with other ones in order to create bigger
    functions.</p>

    <p>So you might have a function that goes from type A to B, and another
    function that goes from type B to C, and you can compose them to create a
    new <em>"holistic"</em> function that goes from type A to C. You can do all sorts of kind of cool kind of programming tricks around
    controlling effects, and being able to reason a lot better about what the
    functions do.</p>

    <p>Functional programming tends to have -not always-, but tends to have a
    bit of an emphasis on principles of <em>"purity"</em>, in the sense that functions
    shouldn't affect the world outside of them – which tends to happen quite a
    lot in <em>OOP</em>, where the functions themselves may do
    something outside of the function's scope.</p>

    <p>A common example is that, for example in Python, you might have a function
    <em>“add”</em> that takes sums two numbers, but there's no guarantee that when you
    call this function it will not also trigger the release of a nuclear warhead
    halfway around the world.</p>

    <p>There is no way of locking down this kind of impurity. Whereas in
    Haskell, it takes two integers and returns two integers, that's all it will
    do. To have effects outside of it, they have to be marked as that.</p>

    <p>I just like the way that functional programming forces you to think about
    you all the problems you're trying to solve in a different way, and I really
    like a lot of the principles around purity and being able to look at a chunk
    of code and just reason about what it's doing, and the scope of the function
    is, it's like more compressed, let's say.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2 onclick="audioTime(5,25)">As a coder, what is your perspective on the current omnipresence of
      technology?</h2>

    <p>It's a kind of a mixed bag. Like, it's fairly evident that the quality of
    my life and the lives of the people that I know are enabled through this
    kind of all-pervasive hegemony of computational technology; and in a lot of
    cases, I feel that that has been a very positive thing.</p>

    <p>I think the broadening of communication like, the kind of effective
    communications [at our disposal] have kind of shrunk the world in a way that like I feel a lot
    of people find is a negative, but I find it quite a positive you know.</p>

    <p>I'm like – I was always a bit of a kind of like a loner growing up, but
    being able to have kind of social connections outside of your immediate
    geographical space, through communication technology, I always felt was like
    incredibly important to my development, and I think it's a thing that a lot
    of people take for granted.</p>

    <img src="img/mikaprofile.jpeg" alt="mika">

    <p>But on the other hand, I do feel that the all-pervasiveness of technology
    today, especially when it comes to I guess kind of like, when it comes to
    how we as human beings behave (...) these all pervasive systems pop up where they
    ingrain quite perverse incentives when it comes to information seeking, in
    terms of like the news that we consume or the kind of way that we relate to
    other human beings.</p>

    <p>It can sometimes I think – it has been almost like gamed by the sheer kind
    of ubiquity of kind of technology, and how it's able to come to monitor
    people's reactions to things and then reinforce like how information adapts
    to people.</p>

    <p>But I don't think that's a consequence of technology, I think it's more
    of a sum between technology -plus- capitalism, in the sense of – yeah, it's kind
    of difficult to think about one without the other.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2 onclick="audioTime(8,05)">What is it about programming that you love so deeply?</h2>

    <p>For me the act of programming is kind of strange,
    because it's, self-evidently – when you go through people's websites,
    -especially if we speak about the <a href="https://webring.xxiivv.com/" target="_blank">Merveilles
    webring</a>-, you are confronted with
    quite a wide range of creative approaches to the problem of designing a
    space, and so it's quite a creative act.</p>

    <p>But at the same time, you produce something concrete – I feel like the
    thing that I like a lot about coding is that it's this kind of creation –
    it allows you to kind of create an assemblage of I guess, creative
    output that oftentimes directly relates to other people's creative output,
    in a kind of like network of artistic
    endeavor.</p>

    <p>I feel like coding has allowed myself to express myself creatively, but
    also develop myself creatively. Before I kind of got involved in
    Merveilles, the way I thought about web design, and tool design, and how you
    present kind of information or yourself to like the internet, as it were,
    was quite limited.</p>

    <p>What I love about Merveilles is that it gave me this rich kind of
    vocabulary of projects that you can like pull things from, and like learn
    from, and find techniques and ways of like expressing yourself in
    [different] ways.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2 onclick="audioTime(10,00)">Some of your projects focus on the tracking of different metrics.
      Why is that?</h2>

    <p>I feel like tracking, especially for me like, with my like
      <em><a href="https://hraew.autophagy.io/faereld/" target="_blank">Færeld</a></em>,
    project and with <em><a href="https://hraew.autophagy.io" target="_blank">Hrǽw</a></em>,
    as well, which kind of produces a visualization of
    the stuff that I track, it's mostly because I feel like tracking has become
    quite important in Merveilles, just because it allows you to [pin down]
    something that's quite abstract and nebulous, in a way that then you can
    like present it to someone else in a kind of like, it kind of scratches that
    itch in a way of seeing a number.</p>

    <p>For me, when I made my <em>Færeld</em> time tracking tool, it was – the
    purpose of it, the driving force behind it, was kind of twofold. One was
    well, I find that <em>“metrification"</em> has often kind of affected outcomes in the
    sense of: I think like a lot of us have had like experiences
    of like in a day-to-day work, of being tracked on a metric, and then being
    forced to optimize that metric as much as possible, for the gain of someone
    else, whether it be an employer, or whatever.</p>

    <p>So I thought <em>“it would be nice to metric-ify the things about myself
    that I care about -in this case, how much time I spent on creative
    projects-, in a way that allows me to optimize them for myself, and not for some
    others seeking to extact value from me”</em>.</p>

    <img src="img/mikafaereld.jpeg" alt="faereld tracking">

    <p>And the kind of second driving motivation behind it was that at the time
    I had quite low self-esteem about like the projects that I was doing; I felt
    like I was never doing anything useful, I had this kind of like sinking
    feeling that I was just kind of treading water, or stagnating, developing
    the things that I care about myself.</p>

    <p>And so time tracking was also a way to say, <em>"I am actually
    developing, I am actually putting work into the things that I care about,
    and progressing"</em>, and that allowed me to see the like distribution of what
    kind of activities I was doing when it came to these things, it was kind of
    self-affirming, in a way?</p>

    <p>And yeah, it is kind of strange, that you feel like you're not doing
    anything until you track what you're doing – and then you have a bar graph
    and numbers like, the numbers don't lie to you in the same way that your
    brain does.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2 onclick="audioTime(12,49)">Most Merveilles' projects seek a kind of autonomy from tradition.
    Why do you think that is?</h2>

    <p>Yeah, I definitely agree with what you said about like, people trying to
    find some kind of clarity or, taking the messy systems that they have to
    interact with, in this case like the Gregorian calendar, and trying
    something else that they think might adhere more to their own
    principles.</p>

    <p>(...) When I first started using my calendar, that's like based on
    the French Revolutionary calendar, I missed quite a few doctors appointments
    just like updates and things like that <em>(laughs)</em> so in effect, even though
    the calendar itself is kind of systematic and rational, I guess, it did
    introduce a little bit of additional hassle into my life.</p>

    <p>And I think maybe this also feeds into the almost kind of obsession that
    there is within the Merveilles <em>"minimalism"</em>, when [we] create interfaces.
     Like I'm thinking of a lot of Devine projects especially, the
     <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/orca.html" target="_blank">live music
    coding tool [Orca]</a>, or whatever (…) there’s definitely a drive towards minimalism as
    a way of I think having systems and interfaces that are smaller in scope,
    but much clearer in what they're trying to do.</p>

    <p>And I feel that yeah, I think this is a way of trying to fight back
    against the messiness and clutter of like the systems of our
    [day-to-day].</p>

    <hr>

    <h2 onclick="audioTime(14,41)">You're speaking of technology as a creative act, but society at large seems
    disquieted by it.</h2>

    <p>(...) I'm not quite sure – I feel like this kind of tendency also happened with
    the word <em>"algorithm"</em>; like, its simple definition [is that] an algorithm is
    just something that follows a list of steps to produce a mathematical
    result, or a computational result.</p>

    <p>But like the word algorithm has become infused with this kind of
    secondary meaning, or context, in which it speaks to a kind of like
    almost <em>"kafka-esque"</em>, opaque kind of bureaucracy.</p>

    <p>So for something to be algorithmic, is not like speaking in the sense
    that maybe a computer scientist might understand it, but for something to
    the algorithmic means to be kind of opaque and bureaucratic and a decision
    made not only away from where you can see it, but also potentially made to
    take advantage of you.</p>

    <p>I think this trend will probably get worse. I feel like, as more and
    more kinds of systems become codified, for lack of a better
    word, or automated, people will tend to associate the bad things about these
    systems with automation.</p>

    <h3 class="quote">Coding itself is a hammer – you can use it to create
    something or to hit someone in the head.</h3>

    <p>I feel like a lot of the
    kind of creative potentials of programming are maybe at least [right now]
    being lost in kind of popular consciousness, and not for unfair reasons. A lot of
    people's day-to-day interactions with automated systems are being colored by
    this kind of opaque decision making.</p>

    <p>I mean it's kind of bad because like if something works
    well you don't tend to notice it, and I feel like that's often the case with
    programming: if something that's programmed looks well,
    and has a positive effect,
    then it tends not to be noticed – but when something breaks, or has a
    negative effect, then it kind of makes itself known and stands out.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2 onclick="audioTime(17,20)">So your perspective is that algorithms themselves
      are not the cause, but the effect?</h2>

    <p>Yeah, I often feel like [there’s] a <em>"naturalistic fallacy"</em>, when it comes
    to algorightms. I'm I guess a computational materialist – I
    believe that like <em>"nature"</em> in the sense of you know, like physics, all the
    way up through like cells, to humans, to like everything else, is kind of
    computational in a sense already.</p>

    <p>And I feel [that] this kind of juxtaposition of like the messy natural
    world, versus the orderly algorithmic world, is kind of a false one, in the
    sense that like <em>"neat orderly algorithms"</em> get messy when they become kind of
    dynamic, and when they interact with each other.</p>

    <p>I feel that, kind of, the natural world is a consequence of just lots and
    lots of dynamic algorithmic systems interacting all the time, and I feel
    that people tend to associate one with kind of <em>"goodness"</em> and the other with
    <em>"badness"</em>.</p>

    <p>Mostly because the algorithms that we tend to deal with in our day-to-day
    lives, that we consciously recognize as algorithms, tend to be quite simple,
    in terms of both like kind of the domain that they're trying to like <em>"compute"</em>
    over, and the kind of outcomes that they're trying to optimise for.</p>

    <p>Like for example, human relationships are computational processes; but the
    things that people dislike about like, <em>Tinder</em>, and relationship apps and
    like this kind of <em>"algorithm-ization"</em> of human relationships, is not
    necessarily that it's algorithmized – but it’s more that like the algorithm
    itself is a lot smaller in scope, and it's not necessarily optimized towards
    the end that -you- would like.</p>

    <p>I feel like algorithms tend to get a bit of a bad rap (...)
      and I feel, deep in my heart, that everything is one big
    algorithm. (…) I do believe there is a way to design algorithms that humans
    like.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2 onclick="audioTime(20,17)">Could you walk me through how you got into coding,
      and where you want to go in the future?</h2>

    <p>In terms of like, how I got into coding itself, it was not a path I
    entirely decided by myself; when I was at school, a subject that I loved,
    and still love, was English literature; especially Shakespeare – I was
    really into Shakespeare, still am; and my entire kind of plan for myself
    would be to go to University to study English literature.</p>

    <p>But I came from a strict home, so my dad was quite adamant that I should
    focus on a <em>"real"</em> subject, and at the time I liked computers, but [more] as a
    kind of consumer object, like – I played like <em>Unreal Tournament</em> and stuff on
    them, and <em>RuneScape</em>. I liked using computers, so I thought <em>"hey,
    going to this computing class in
    college might be cool"</em>.</p>

    <p>(…) I had no real intention of learning to code [then], it was more like
    <em>"well, computers seem useful"</em>. But
    through that class, and also through the work that I did, I really came to
    love programming and computing as creative endeavours.</p>

    <p>And like, in a way, I kind of almost went back to where I was, in the
    sense that like I feel like programming has a lot of the creative like,
    <em>"positives"</em>, that I found when I did like English literature: a lot of like
    analysis, and thinking about the context, and interpretation of texts.</p>

    <h3 class="quote">When I program, I think a lot about analysis, context, and interpretation
    of the programming text in front of me – so I feel like I've not deviated too
    far.</h3>

    <p>In terms of where I want to go – at the moment I'm reading quite a lot of
    <em>"philosophy of mind"</em>, like neurobiology books, mostly popular books, a few
    textbooks here in that because I started to kind of get interested in the
    notion of, just, not <em>“rationality”</em> in the kind of like stoic kind of sense,
    but just like, just thinking as a computational act.</p>

    <p>I started to get quite interested in (…) this stance of <em>"eliminative
    materialism"</em>, which is all about how the concept that we have about the
    mind, and thinking, are all kind of like phantom concepts; and that they
    don't actually have like a direct correlation in like the kind of neural
    configuration of your brain, that kind of stuff.</p>

    <p>Which I find quite interesting. I mean it's kind of self-refuting in the sense of like,
       <em>"I think I don't exist"</em>, which is like, well
    <em>(laughs)</em> but yeah, outside of that, I hope to build more tools that people
    get to use; I'm trying to get more involved in software as a way of kind of
    working on tools that other developers use, and get some kind of value and act
    as a kind of force multiplier.</p>

    <p>Other than that, I would love to continue listening to music and
      making monochromatic websites and things.</p>
