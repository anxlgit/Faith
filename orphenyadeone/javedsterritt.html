   <h1>The Human Condition</h1>

   <img class="heroimg" src="profiles/javedsterritt.jpeg" alt="javed sterritt">

   <p>Hi, I'm <a href="https://www.javedsterritt.com/" target="_blank">Javed Sterritt</a>, I'm a filmmaker, content creator – I've been
   working as a director, editor and motion designer for the last 10-15 years.</p>

   <p>I [also] run a YouTube channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GoodBloodGames/" target="_blank"><em>Good Blood</em></a>, where I create video essays
   talking about storytelling, and pop culture, and a little bit of the hidden
   decisions creatives make in their creative works.</p>

   <hr>

   <h2 onclick="audioTime(0,51)">How do you find balance between your professional work and the YouTube essays?</h2>

   <p>That’s a really good question, how do I balance both the professional
   stuff and the YouTube, kind of experimental stuff – it is always a tricky
   balance, but what I try to do is bring everything that I learned – I think it works really well together,
   everything that I learn professionally I can then bring to YouTube… actually
   just give me a second, <em>(checking)</em>, I think it was peaking a little bit...</p>

   <p><em>(mic adjustements)</em></p>

   <img src="img/javedkirby.gif" alt="kirby">

   <p>...yeah so I think it works really well together, everything that I learned
   professionally, I can bring to what I'm creating on YouTube. It's quite
   important, and I don't want to stop learning from being actually out there
   and on the job.</p>

   <p>I still think there is quite a lot to learn about storytelling, in
   communications and in creative works – I think if I was just doing YouTube, I
   think my learnings would be quite slow, as I try and teach myself how to, you know, how
   to do things. But being out there and working under other storytellers, and
   being under pressure, I think you learn a lot from being out on the field.</p>

   <hr>

   <h2 onclick="audioTime(2,20)">What is your perspective on the current algorithm-ization of YouTube?</h2>

   <p>There's definitely – you know, everyone talks about the algorithm, right?
   Like the algorithm, YouTube’s algorithm, is this big monster that kind of
   hangs over the creativity of YouTube – and you have to give it the right
   foods to appease it. That's kind of the idea with YouTube, and I've been
   quite fortunate in that I have had a job outside of [it], and so I haven't
   relied too much on trying to make a living just from [that].</p>

   <p>And so what that has meant is that I've been using YouTube just to
   experiment. That's why I have a lot of different styles you know, I have a
   short <em>Mario + Rabbids</em> video that's 7 minutes long or something – and then I've
   got like a half an hour <em>God of War</em> video or a half-hour <em>Ocarina of Time</em>
   video, and it's just experimenting, and figuring out what I really enjoy
   doing. So I have had that luxury.</p>

   <img src="img/javedharry.jpeg" alt="harry potter">

   <p>I think if I was ever to go and do YouTube full-time, and try and make it
   a living, I would probably have to change the way that I do some things. What
   I found is that my channel has been growing, and it's interesting to see
   because you can see some channels who pump out videos pretty regularly – my
   videos have been two years apart <em>(laughs)</em> and there's still a little bit of
   growth there.</p>

   <p>But I think what I really tried to do is: I think with pumping out videos
   fast, that comes with it a sense of rush, whereas I like to really look at
   the texts, really look at the story, that I'm trying to tell, and really
   workshop the message to try and create something that resonates with
   people.</p>

   <p>And whatever you're finding is that, these really thoughtful, emotional
   works, [they] seem to be a [good] way to grow a channel you know, it's not just there's
   one way where you're pumping videos really quickly. So that's been of
   interesting to see people responding emotionally to the stuff that I'm
   creating. There's more than one way to go about it.</p>

   <hr>

   <h2 onclick="audioTime(5,05)">What drove you to choose a more in-depth, narrative kind of video-essay?</h2>

   <p>I think it’s OK that there's more than one way to talk about things. It comes
   down to a personal experience I think; there's definitely a place for the
   more technical analyses (is that the word analysis-es? <em>(laughs)</em>) you know
   what I mean, but there's definitely a place for it, and sometimes I enjoy
   watching those videos – just really simple, or really fast, someone's
   10-minute review of a game, where they tackle a lot of different subjects:
   the mechanics, the story, the graphics, etc. Kind of a classic video game
   review.</p>

   <p>But then there is, you know – I think there's never been a time like now
   for video game storytelling, where I think we're really pushing the
   envelope with the kind of stories that we can tell. Rewind 20 years ago, and
   the stories weren't as fleshed out, or as character-driven, whereas now
   technology allows for bigger cinematics.</p>

   <p>And so I think it's become a lot easier to explore and analyze bigger
   storytelling [ideas], because there are just more and better stories being
   told. So I’m not sure if that answers your question – I don't think it
   necessarily has to be a marriage between the two, where it has to be just one
   type of review. I think, having 30-40 different types of reviews, and ways to
   talk about games, they're all completely valid.</p>

   <p>I think personally I'm drawn to the character stuff: I'm really drawn to
   the storytelling, and you know, deep down inside, I think my goal, as to what
   I'm doing on, my goal for my channel on YouTube is to try and prove to the
   non-gamers that video games can be art, that they can be powerful
   storytelling tools – and I think that is the drive behind a lot of what I do
   is just proving that.</p>

   <hr>

   <h2 onclick="audioTime(7,40)">Do you think people may still have some qualms about considering videogames as an artform?</h2>

   <p>The <em>"videogames are art"</em> discussion is one that has been going on for a long
   time, and what's so tricky about the conversation is that video games – again,
   their inception was to be <em>“fun”</em>, to provide some fun. And after some time,
   different developers and storytellers have taken videogames and started to
   twist them and turn them into their own thing.</p>

   <p>Man, there's just so much stuff to talk about like – if you think about,
   when you use the word <em>"art"</em>, right, I think what comes into a lot of people's
   minds is standing in an art gallery looking at a painting. But I think once
   we understand that all art forms, including paintings, they're all
   interactive, there's not one type of art where the audience is passive.</p>

   <p>Painting requires us to take a step in and consider what's going on,
   without the audience’s [reaction to] the art piece (…) artists wouldn't be
   famous, you know?</p>

   <h3 class="quote"> [Paintings] are reflections of the human condition, and
   video games are the same thing.</h3>

   <p>If we look at say, something like <em>Among Us</em>, it's about finding out
   who's the mole, who's the killer – and as much as that's fun, you can find
   aspects of the human condition in that, where it's collaboration, betrayal, all these things.

    <p>(…) To answer your question, I don't think we're very far away from
   everyone thinking about video games as being art. Full stop.</p>

   <hr>

   <h2 onclick="audioTime(10,12)">So you see it as a matter of time then?</h2>

   <p>It's the classic case of you know, a new piece of technology comes in, and
   the older generation doesn't understand it, and so they reject it. It's a
   pretty common story, and the same thing is probably the same for video games
   – you know like, [in] my generation, everyone I know has a gaming console, and
   even games on their phone, whereas my parents don't play any video games. My grandparents definitely didn’t.</p>

   <p>So yeah, I think there is definitely a
   generational thing going on, but I've got my children, and my kids are
   growing up in a household with video games. I play video games a lot with my
   kids, and it's just a normal part of life: we sit down and we play it and we
   enjoy it together, we experience these stories together, and we talk about
   it, so it's such a normal thing now, and so that's why I think with the next
   generation after my kids, it'll be even more normalized.</p>

   <hr>

   <h2 onclick="audioTime(11,20)">On a different note, have you noticed your content evolving? Do you have any main lessons from past video-essays?</h2>

   <p>I think both of these questions can be summed up by saying that I've
   matured as a communicator over time. If you look at my older <em>Good Blood</em>
   videos, you see that they're a bit more timid, a bit more flashy (…) but one of the
   big things, one of my greatest learnings, running the channel, and coming
   from a motion graphics background, was that [in] my earlier works, I [relied
   on] really flashy graphics to get me through, whereas my messaging, what I
   was actually saying underneath, wasn't that strong.</p>

   <p>It wasn't that thoughtful, and I gave it the least attention, and what I ended
   up finding was that people can kind of sniff sniff that out from a mile away
   <em>(laughs)</em>.</p>

   <p>When we watch content, TV shows, or cinema, whatever, the audience has
   their feelings out, ready to be attached to something. Whether it's a
   character, or message, there's always this longing to attach ourselves [to
   something], and I think [that] what my older work suffered from was that it
   didn't have a through-line, it didn't have a message that was really solid and
   thought through. So they failed.</p>

   <img src="img/javedlaboman.gif" alt="nintendo labo">

   <p>Essentially, that is what happened. The videos that I
   removed were the ones that I felt like didn't have a good through-line, they
   relied too much on the flashy graphics; especially that <em>Sonic</em> one that you
   brought up, that's Exhibit A. That had a really thin message that wasn't very
   well-thought-out.</p>

   <p>I tried to blind everybody with animation, and the flashy graphics, and
   the graphs – but what was underneath was not sound reasoning <em>(laughs)</em>. I like
   to think I've grown as a storyteller, I've grown as a communicator and now
   I'm – the stuff I'm creating now, I put 90% of my effort into the message,
   into the story, and what I'm trying to actually say.</p>

   <p>And then I figure out, <em>“ok, what are the graphics on top [going to be],
   what are the visuals doing”</em>. I swapped it around, and I think it's making
   my work now, I think, just a lot stronger.</p>

   <hr>

   <h2 onclick="audioTime(14,13)">What is your perspective on the current situation of the gaming world?</h2>

   <p> It’s such a tricky time – basically what's happened is that the line
   between developer and consumer has thinned out so much. I remember back in
   the early nineties, when I had a <em>Sega Mega Drive</em> or <em>Genesis</em>, you had to call
   the special hotline to get secrets. I'm not sure if you remember, but that
   was the closest we really got to contacting developers, or contacting an
   insider, you know.</p>

   <p>Some of my videos have been acknowledged by the creators themselves; my
   <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> video was acknowledged by Jason and Andy from Naughty Dog,
   and also the <em>“Untangling God of War"</em> was retweeted by Cory Balrog. Yeah, that
   was amazing; but as a kid, you never think it would happen, – the idea of a
   developer, the creator of a video game, would be in contact with you, or
   recognize you, is just insane.</p>

   <p>But now, it's just a common part of the discourse – you find them on
   Twitter, and it's so easy to reach developers now and it's so easy to create
   petitions, and it's so easy to create mobs and retweets on, you know – trying
   to get the developers attention.</p>

   <h3 class="quote">The line between developer and
   consumer has thinned out. And I think what's happened officially is that
   we've penetrated the wall between the two camps.</h3>

   <p>And so it's like, when we get a new game from a developer – is that really
   the full creative team's vision? I think a lot of the time studios are [aware]
   of their fanbases now, that's why you can find fanservice just everywhere.
   You know, I loved the <em>Last of Us 2</em>, it was such a risk, but for me that was
   such a big, it held a better high – it was like, "we're telling our own
   story".</p>

   <p>It wasn't really impacted by the fanbase, because if they were really
   considering the fanbase the whole time, they wouldn't have killed off the
   same characters, they wouldn't have made these big choices, they wouldn't
   have made you play as other characters you know, [all] these
   risky decisions.</p>

   <p>I personally loved it, it was difficult to play on; we could go into that
   whole thing with <em>TLOU2</em> (...) it's difficult to play because you become
   attached to these characters, but I love that they took such a mess of risk
   on a triple A title like that. I’m a little bit scared about the future of
   where it's going.</p>

   <p>I think everyone was up in arms about <em>TLOU2</em>, because it wasn't the story
   that they wanted, and that's the big thing, it was like, [people said], <em>“this
   is not the story that we wanted!”</em>. And in the back of my mind, I'm like,
   <em>"well, you guys go to learn how to code, and go make your own game, with your
   own story!”</em></p>

   <p>Yeah, it's tricky, and I'm sorry if I'm being a bit scattered – there are
   a lot of thoughts that come in, but yeah. It's becoming a tricky environment
   to navigate for developers, and storytellers, for sure.</p>

   <hr>

   <h2 onclick="audioTime(18,45)">Speaking about fan interactions,
     how has yours been with your own fanbase?</h2>

   <p>First of all, it's crazy to think that I have a fan base. I don't think I
   think about <em>Good Blood</em> or even myself like that – I don't see myself as
   someone who's famous. I think, what I really am trying to do is make really
   good work – basically increase my profile so I can do bigger and better
   things, but what I think it's at the core of my work it's shining a light on
   other people's creative works, you know <em>(laughs)</em>.</p>

   <p>And so, when it comes to interacting maybe with the <em>Good Blood</em> fan base, I
   [do] think there is a fan base there, but I'm pretty, pretty proactive like –
   I'm at the Discord, and chatting a lot to the people in the <em>Good Blood</em> Discord; I
   don't really see myself as above them in any way; and there was the case of
   somebody very first video that we bought up talked about before, was the
   <em>Sonic</em> video.</p>

   <p>Basically, what happened was I presented a new design, I did a redesign for
   <em>Sonic</em>, it's not very good – but it was something that I injected into the
   scene, just to see what happens, hoping that it would go well. You know, I
   don't think anyone really creates something hoping that it would go bad, but
   the <em>Sonic</em> Community really struggled to get on board.</p>

   <img src="img/javedsonic.gif" alt="sonic the hedgehog">

   <p>And I got a lot of hate from it; with a little really positive criticism,
   really valid comments like <em>“hey, this design wouldn't work, because you know,
   XYZ”</em> – but I had other people saying like <em>“hey you're a faggot, you're a
   hipster"</em>, you know, whatever.</p>

   <p>That was really interesting, as my first piece of work that I put out into
   the scene, like – that was everyone's first impression of who I was, and that
   was really difficult. That took me a long time to process. I'm glad that was
   the first one, because I was still really small and it taught me
   really quickly that I need to do more research, and that I can't really be
   putting my ego into my work.</p>

   <p>So I'm not sure if that answers your question but I feel like I've had
   some of a spectrum – although definitely not the hate that other creators
   get. My work especially is, really – my brand is not <em>"Javed"</em>, my brand is
   <em>"professional, cinematic on 10, about other people's work"</em>, and so I think I
   went under the radar a little bit, there's no controversy around <em>"Javed"</em> really
   because I'm not really putting my own personal life out there like other
   people do.</p>

   <p>So yeah (...) I think my interactions online have been fairly tame only because
   I don't present a lot of drama, like other YouTubers may do.</p>

   <hr>

   <h2 onclick="audioTime(22,18)">Where do you see yourself going in the future?</h2>

   <p>Yeah, my life has actually changed quite a lot. I just shot a new
   update video [at the time of this interview], it took me some time to put it
   up on YouTube, because the job that I was working at finished up a couple of
   weeks ago, and so the terrain of my life has had a bit of an earthquake, so
   to speak – so I've been forced to reassess parts of my life, and figure out
   what takes priority, and what do I actually want to do, now that that
   job is finished up.</p>

   <p>I really do want to push more into <em>Good Blood</em>, that's where my heart lies –
   yeah, that's what's up. Before I said that I don't really present myself in
   my work, but I think [that], at the same time, if you were to watch all of the
   content on <em>Good Blood</em> you’d really be getting a glimpse into my soul, you
   know. Like, it's very much me; not in a physical sense, but in the way in
   which I think about things, and process things, and then create things.</p>

   <img src="img/javedgod.jpeg" alt="untangling god of war">

   <p>So I would love to push more into [that], and I would love to actually
   keep going with the essays, because I really enjoy the research process, but
   also spend time with my own stories, experimenting with different types of
   storytelling.</p>

   <p>I have a few little projects that I kind of have [stashed] away in the
   background, along with a bunch of other essays as well. That's kind of the
   next step. Also getting, doing some freelance stuff on the side, like – I do
   believe there's still more to learn from other storytellers out there. I'd
   hate to cut off my chance to learn stuff now, because, like I said before,
   [you learn things] a lot quicker when you're out in the world and actually
   making stuff. So yeah, that's kind of the plan.</p>

   <hr>

   <h2 onclick="audioTime(24,40)">And in terms of the videogame and developer scene, how do you see it evolving?</h2>

   <p>I just think that as long as developers and storytellers are staying true
   to themselves, while making works that they really believe in, it will be
   fine. There's always going to be someone who doesn't like an <em>IP</em> [Intellectual Property <em>ie.</em> game franchise]
   for some reason, but I think what's dangerous is if we start creating content
   just for fanbases (…)
   telling stories we know that everyone just wants to hear.</p>

   <p>I think that's when we are in trouble. I think we need to keep pushing the
   envelope, just like <em>TLOU2</em> did, just like <em>God of War</em> is doing. As
   long as we stay true to the stories we want to be telling, and we're staying
   true to their expression, it will be fine. I personally am really excited for
   what comes next – I feel like we are just scratching the surface now with
   what we can do with video games. So yeah, I'm excited.</p>
