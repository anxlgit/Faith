   <h1>Nudging The Needle</h1>

   <img class="heroimg" src="profiles/williamfelker.jpeg" alt="william felker">

   <p>Yes so, my name is <a href="https://twitter.com/gndclouds" target="_blank">William</a> – and I think originally, a couple years
    ago, I called myself an interaction designer, but I think more recently
    my skills have become kind of a blend of doing design research and
    software development.</p>

    <p>And kind of the most recent evolution of that has been me understanding a
    lot more of natural systems that are surrounded by nature, and trying to
    figure out how we can productize solutions to those systems that help us
    combat climate change.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2 onclick="audioTime(0,52)">You started your journey by working on research labs, right?</h2>

    <p>I think out of school, it was a great opportunity to be able to work
    right away in the Valley, and start getting into (...) these
    larger companies.</p>

    <p>I was a fairly technical and code-savvy designer coming out of school, so
    research labs made a lot of sense for me at the time, because it meant that
    I could typically communicate what the emerging technology was with an
    engineering team, but then I could also prototype something quickly to test
    with users, that kind of removed and abstracted whatever the emerging
    technology was.</p>

    <p>So you know, I could test something using blockchain, without actually
    needing to tell people what blockchain [is] (...) and so that kind of process of
    translation was I think a unique opportunity for me, because I technically
    could build some of the stuff and understand how it worked, but my
    background and degree was all design-based, and so I still could do the
    actual full creation of what the thing was.</p>

    <p>And then I also interviewed people with my research skills and got
    feedback from them, understanding how we could make anything better in the
    future, etc.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2 onclick="audioTime(2,00)">How did that develop into founding Tiny Factories?</h2>

    <p>After leaving those research labs, I started to do freelance
    software development, and in that process, I found that I really missed
    having the kind of studio environment that you kind of get with that – I
    don't think that people in labs would call it a studio environment (...) [but] I
    think I really missed that once I started working as a freelance.</p>

    <p>And with a couple of other friends I just met by traveling, we kind of
    all agreed that we needed a way in which we could continue to have a studio,
    and other people in the studio to just kind of support us emotionally, as we
    did our own work.</p>

    <p>Because many of us, we had full-time jobs or contracts (...) but
    we also pursued our own personal projects, and it's those that tend to be
    the projects where we do the most exploration and growth.</p>

    <p>And so we felt it was really important to figure out how we could grow a
    <a href="https://www.tinyfactories.space/" target="_blank">supportive community of people doing that</a>, and help that community become,
    ideally, financially independent while doing that, which is kind of a hard I
    think, transition for people to make.</p>

    <img src="img/williamtiny.png" alt="Tiny Factories">

    <p>Because suddenly now, you need to figure out your own work pipeline, and
    you need to have a portfolio that appeals to clients, there is a lot of I
    think baggage that comes with doing freelancing, that you're not necessarily
    taught in school, and it's kind of hard thing to do.</p>

    <p>And so, the goal has
    really been to have a small controlled community of people [to whom] we can
    occasionally provide work to, if they need it, but otherwise really just
    allow them to figure out how they can thrive through their own independent
    creative practice, whatever that may be.</p>

    <p>It could be, for some it's writing, a couple people do pottery, some
    people are kind of in the more traditional tech and code side and make games
    and things like that; right now it's a pretty wide-reaching thing. And then
    we just try to support them as much as we can.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2 onclick="audioTime(3,51)">The group has a kind of screening or admission process. Is this intentional?</h2>

    <p>For us that was very intentional; we started out our community action by
    having in-person gatherings, about I'd say every 3 to 4 weeks, and then
    obviously Covid happened <em>(laughs)</em> so we had to move a lot of it
    virtually.</p>

    <p>At that time we were very open with letting anybody into the group, so
    basically, if you would come to a gathering, at every gathering we would
    present like, <em>"here's the Discord link, you can join here”</em> – and
    the issue we had is that, you very quickly have exponential growth, but a
    decline of overall engagement.</p>

    <p>And therefore it felt like the service we were trying to offer wasn't
    actually valuable to everybody, and yet everybody was still just kind of
    present and not contributing all the time. And so, once Covid started, we
    kind of did a reset, and we basically closed the group, and we switched to a
    monthly payment model.</p>

    <p>Not a lot, it's like 10 bucks, 10 to 20 bucks, I don't remember where
    we're at right now; and the goal of that was to try to understand and
    reinforce the fact that – in the same way you typically would pay to go to a
    third space, like you a hackerspace, a library space or those types of
    things (...) we tried to recreate that same type of environment and vibe.</p>

    <img src="img/willmembers.gif" alt="Tiny Factories Members">

    <p>Because for us, that reinforces this level of accountability that you
    tend to get where people are there because they actually value the other
    people in the group, and they want to contribute, and they also then want to
    be active members of that community.</p>

    <p>A lot of these other groups I think are great, it's great that they're
    creating spaces for people to dwell on the internet, and we need to keep
    getting better at that. But I think sometimes there's a lack of engagement
    that happens after thei r sizestarts to become too big.</p>

    <p>And we really wanted to figure out how can we avoid that that part of it
    – and so right now, our current thinking is that, by having applications,
    and you know, by talking to each new member usually at least two times
    before they join us, we get to get to know them better.</p>

    <p>And of course, we don't have in-person gatherings yet, but we still hold
    virtual gatherings (...) and it's been a good way for the community to really get
    to know everybody in the group (...) because I think otherwise you kind of,
    you enter a group and you either have to be very active in the group or
    everyone has to be very open to new members.</p>

    <p>(…) We’re still a very trusting group nevertheless, and so it's easy for
    people to say, <em>"this week at work was really bad"</em>, or I <em>"had this really
    terrible freelance contract"</em> or what have you, and we've all been in those
    situations.</p>

    <p>And it means that we can kind of support each other not only in terms of
    work, and what we're making, but also emotionally, when we need it to;
    because it can be hard to be out on your own, and find contracts and
    projects and all of this, it can be a very stressful thing.</p>

    <p>So we try to support everyone in all kinds of aspects and journeys.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2 onclick="audioTime(6,52)">Let's talk a bit about your main field of interest now, which is climate change.</h2>

    <p>It’s a crazy problem; and the thing I'm realizing right now, and the
    thing that I finally owned up to, is that this is not something that I can
    in any scale accomplish in my lifetime, and it won't be accomplished in the
    generational lifetime after me either.</p>

    <p>And so I think anything I can do right now to help kind of nudge that
    needle towards us not hitting 4º, if that's still possible -it's not really
    clear right now-, I think would be great.</p>

    <p>But I think my approach right now has been, all of the
    reading that I've done – and you know, I kind of approach these problems, if
    I don't know a lot about the topic, I just try to find as many of the
    current experts as possible, and then basically read everything they've
    read, and kind of try get a good sense [of] the space.</p>

    <h3 class="quote">We’ve faced a similar
    challenge before, when there was a hole forming in the Ozone layer, and we
    were able to come together globally and solve that. But the thing that
    feels different now is that the scale of the problem is already out of
    hand.</h3>

    <p>And the thing that's surprising to me is that we've really had pretty
    active knowledge about this since the 70s, and because of that we have a
    tremendous amount of really fantastic scientific solutions that we know work,
    and yet we're not implementing them fast enough <em>(laughs)</em> and we're not even
    implementing some of them at all.</p>

    <p>And so from my perspective, it's a mix of a politics problem, it's a
    human systems problem, and it's just kind of a more broader natural systems
    problem.</p>

    <p>I think humans tend to think of themselves as being pretty isolated, and
    separate from nature, and I think if there's anything I've learned from the
    software work I've done is: there are a lot of really good opportunities to
    figure out how to make, you know, anything happen.</p>

    <p>In my background there's been a lot of, you know, <em>"how do we get someone
    on board of this app"</em> or <em>"how do we increase user retention"</em>, and all that,
    and so I think we have to apply that same kind of thinking to [this]. There's
    some amazing research that's already been done, about how to interact with
    the Earth.</p>

    <p>[But] I think there isn't enough people I think, right now at least, that
    are figuring out how do we actually think of the Earth as a living natural
    system that we exist as a part of, and how do we start to participate in
    that system, instead of just kind of being fully on the outside, doing
    whatever we want and then being like <em>"oh no, it's getting warmer"</em>.</p>

    <p>And so, right now, I think my hope is really, are there any things I can
    be doing to really make the existing solutions that we know work,
    actionable? Because a lot of them happen, you know, within these giant
    government-funded research projects – sometimes they’re turned into policy
    and sometimes they don't, and then the data is just kind of there.</p>

    <img src="img/willsystem.jpg" alt="systemic change">

    <p>And it's like <em>"well, we know we can replace all these coal power plants,
    but that means we need to find new jobs for all those people, and that takes
    a really long time"</em>. Nuclear as well has very widely varied opinions based
    on where you are in the world, and all these other things.</p>

    <p>And I think, sometimes the policies [may] support these ideas and provide
    funding, but they don't really address just like, the needed human behavior
    change. And I think a lot about how my degree and experience so far have taught
    me is that we need a tremendous amount of human behavior change to actually
    make this happen (laughs).</p>

    <p>And actually the tech industry is very good at it, for better or for
    worse. They're very good at behaviour change, and so applying that to the
    way that we live, in a way that nudges us to -<em>not</em>- make the planet
    uninhabitable, I think will be really important.</p>

    <p>So I'm kind of trying to figure out – can I take my skill of being able
    to translate technologically jargony things from the tech industry, for
    people, and can I do the same thing with technologically jargony science and
    translate to something that is actually actionable, so we can start
    implementing solutions that we know work? We just need to do them.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2 onclick="audioTime(10,43)">Do you think this will continue to be a struggle going forward?</h2>

    <p>I think so, I think it's going to be a challenging transition to make (…)
    I’ve been doing right now a lot of materials research, to try to understand
    if it's actually economically viable for us to be using some of these more
    regenerative and biodegradable materials to replace some of the more toxic
    plastic ones, and in most of the cases, they are.</p>

    <p>Because we're talking about the byproducts of natural systems, and these
    natural systems, I mean, have been evolving for billions of years, without
    our help, so they are very good at doing what they do <em>(laughs)</em> and so if we
    tweak portions of them to make you know, the particular bioplastic we need,
    or something like that, we can do that – and then in return, they typically
    have very good economic returns.</p>

    <p>I mean even just the work presented in <a href="https://drawdown.org/" target="_blank">Project Drawdown</a>,
      which is very,
    I'd say, energy-focused, for the most part; almost all of the
    infrastructure projects they recommend return 2/3 times what the initial
    investment cost in them is. And yet we're not even building them, and I think a lot of it is an
    upfront capital problem.</p>

    <img src="img/willpetrol.jpg" alt="systemic change">

    <p>I think a lot of it, anytime you are creating
    something that works in tandem with an existing natural system, I think over
    time, the cost will go down. I think the main issue is that we've been exploiting
    natural systems instead of working in tandem with them for a long time, and I think because
    of that, we tend to separate the cost of the cause and the effect of the
    product.</p>

    <p>And so, if we actually calculate out the cost of getting petroleum to make
    a plastic, for example – and I’m using plastic as it seems to be the most
    common thing people focus on, in terms of energy production.</p>

    <p>If we think about the cost of getting plastic out of the ocean, by
    getting petroleum, and then turning that into plastic, and all the eventual
    healthcare costs that come from that, and how the burning of petroleum (…)
    impacts the temperatures, which [exacerbates] natural weather events, and
    all those other things, you know, that [cost of plastic] tends to escalate
    pretty quickly.</p>

    <p>It's actually like, a lot more expensive to be doing it the way we're
    doing it <em>(laughs)</em>, but because of how systems are set up, within the actual
    capitalist system, we don't associate those costs as being related, it's
    <em>"oh, I'm making profits, I'm building this thing”</em>.</p>

    <p>And it's not associating that <em>“well, technically, you know, some small tiny
    portion of that, you know, hurricane that was worse because it was hotter out,
    or all those little percentages over time, contribute back to the actual
    cost of creating that material from oil"</em>, and I don't think we think about
    those as being connected.</p>

    <p>I think it's a lot easier to calculate that impact when you're doing
    something that is a part of a natural system because you’re like, <em>“okay, if
    this plastic needs to be broken back down, is it being used to regenerate
    soil for farming, and then is that like replacing a fertilizer?”</em></p>

    <p>Then you can sort of calculate more I think the end-to-end system cost,
    because it's a system and it works together.</p>

    <h3 class="quote">Right now, we kind of
    break [the process] up into chunks, and everybody [takes] a part of the pie, and we
    forget that it's actually still a pie <em>(laughs)</em>.</h3>

    <p>And so I think, because of how capitalism frames [those] <em>“means of
    production”</em>, I don't think we think a lot about [how] these costs probably
    aren't really as cheap as we think. And I think the most common example that you start to see people hint at
    that is probably in the automotive industry.</p>

    <p>When people calculate the total like carbon tax on a vehicle or something like that, we almost always tend
    to leave out the carbon included in the production of the
    vehicle. We're just like thinking about you know, <em>"how much fuel it burns per per
    hour"</em>, and it's like, <em>"well, technically there's a lot more embedded energy
    in that object than just how many pounds of carbon it's burning per hour by
    driving"</em>.</p>

    <p>And so I think we need kind of that reframing and that shift, and we
    really need to create systems that rely on each other, and I think that will
    help make them a lot more resilient as well as things get a bit worse
    climate-wise for a bit.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2 onclick="audioTime(14,59)">What kind of projects would you like to tackle in the future?</h2>

    <p>That's a deep endless list of things <em>(laughs)</em> – yeah, there's never
    a shortage of things I want to work on. Maybe I should clone myself,
    and that could be potentially a way to get more of it done, but I think
    right now kind of some of my current goals are:</p>

    <p>For <em>Tiny Factories</em>, I want to really hone in on being able to make this
    community both self-sustaining, in which a couple people can fully
    contribute to helping maintain it full time; and I think right now, part of
    the reason that works is because of the limited size that we're at, and at
    some point that threshold will break, and I want to understand how we can
    continue to provide a service to people without becoming a giant group.</p>

    <p>And so I think <em>Tiny Factories</em> for me, in some ways, is kind of an
    experiment on new forms of both kind of creative independent practice, and
    working, and even kind of a little bit of an experiment on my how we school
    and learn from each other.</p>

    <img src="img/willconstellation.png" alt="Tiny Factories">

    <p>Because there's this need for, I think, new schooling models to emerge. A
    couple people in the group are transitioning disciplines, and I
    mean even myself like, I feel like I'm transitioning disciplines, while
    being in the group as well, by moving kind ouf out of from like the
    traditional design stuff over the more energy-related things.</p>

    <p>And so that would be kind of an ongoing experiment, to kind of let myself
    and friends and other people (...) keep evolving our disciplines while
    creating a safe space for that to happen. In the real world, it can be a
    little tenuous if you try one experiment that goes wrong, and I think in
    school you have a safe environment to do that, so hopefully, we can keep
    providing that for people.</p>

    <p>(…) I’d like to keep evolving the group towards some form of
    [self-sustainability]. Also, we'd like to be able to provide eventually more
    resources and scholarships for people as well (...) like [having some
    location] where we could tell people, come stay at one of our locations for
    like 3 months, figure out the transition, and kick off your new
    thing.</p>

    <p>We're quite -a ways- from being able to financially support people in doing
    that <em>(laughs)</em> but I do think that's a goal that we definitely have, and I'd
    like to keep working towards that. And I think in terms of my own practice,
    I'm very much I think in the depths right now of figuring out how I can
    transition to be more active on climate work.</p>

    <p>I think a lot of the ways that I see people in my position transition
    right now, is [that] they take their existing skill-set, and transition into
    a climate company. So you know, making a website for an energy company, or
    doing you know, design research with people.</p>

    <p>And I think all that work is valuable and needs to happen, but I think my
    current interest lies in creating an entity that creates climate companies;
    and so that will obviously require a bit of capital, probably quite a lot
    <em>(laughs)</em>, and so right now I'm kind of trying to transition into that (...)
    climate domain where I want to focus on.</p>

    <p>I think a lot of people are solving energy, and I think there are certain
    climate technologies that are going to come over time; at some point,
    maybe not in my lifetime, we will figure out fusion and will solve a
    lot of really tricky energy problems, and so I don't think it makes sense
    for me to put my energy there.</p>

    <p>But I think there are a lot of other systems, and specifically, the way
    we interact with natural systems, that have been kind of disrupted for
    decades, and so disrupted that it's just become normalized.</p>

    <img src="img/williamlake.jpeg" alt="top down lake">

    <p>And so I kind of want to get us back into creating products and services
    that act somehow in harmony with the natural system, because we're part of
    all of them, whether we want to believe it or not, and if we weren't a part
    of them the climate wouldn't be warming and it wouldn't be affecting us, but
    it is, because we are indeed a part of these systems <em>(laughs)</em>.</p>

    <p>And so for me, I'm trying to figure out what kind of starting projects I
    think I could tackle; and I think it'll likely be ocean or water-related,
    based on my current research (...) we're very early in thinking about carbon
    capture, and I think we're very early in thinking about how we use materials
    to build things, and so [I would] like to tie those two things together by
    their relationship with oceanic systems, and see how those can all weave
    themselves together.</p>

    <p>It's a little vague, and I apologize for that, but I think I just kind
    of, I think have carved out: <em>"ok, I'm gonna focus on oceans and I think
    material usage, and carbon capture somewhere in there, and ideally get
    really good on getting experts to solve the problem, and then help
    productize with the experts in the same way you would with a tech company,
    but doing more from a natural-systems and science point of view”</em>.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2 onclick="audioTime(20,22)">Quite a tough spot. Are you hopeful about humanity and the planet?</h2>

    <p>I think honestly, this is a multi-generational problem with the climate,
    and if it doesn't change I think we'll die. Like, we just won't
    survive as a species, the Earth will be fine, other things will evolve, but
    I don't think we will.</p>

    <p>And so I think, in order for us to do that, I think capitalism is so
    deeply embedded in how we function economically, and we associate so much
    value with all these human-made things, instead of the things that already
    exist in nature, that we need to radically shift that focus,
     but that's going to take a very long time. </p>

    <p>And so I think one of the only
    ways we can start to do that, is honestly in some ways by fully
    embracing capitalism, and purely undercutting all of the other competitors
    in some capacity. So how do you make certain clean energies cheaper than coal?</p>

    <p>You know,
    solar [energy] is there now. I think there's a lot of transportation systems
    that we need to be doing more of, like rail has almost always been cheaper
    than driving or shipping stuff via car of boat, and yet if you look at
    American rail systems, they’re still a complete mess, but other countries
    really have it down because it makes much more sense, it’s better, it’s more
    efficient.</p>

    <p>And so I think, I would love to see a thing in which we kind of find this
    next evolution of capitalism: because I do think it is very much just going
    to be an evolution. I think everything we do is I think an evolution,
    there's always, politically things tend to be presented as pretty like black
    and white, all the time and like, like <em>"the only option"</em>, and realistically,
    nothing we've ever done is that black and white.</p>

    <p>Everything is just a small step, and it's in our own evolutionary process to
    create and shift between these different economic systems, and I think we'll
    get there – but I think in the meantime the solution I see is, you do need to
    kind of use the existing system to your advantage as much as possible, to
    help that transition happen.</p>

    <p>(…) One thing that would definitely help the world is if we had a
    healthier population of whales migrating up and down [our] coasts, that helps
    with carbon sequestration in a very tremendous way, but there's not really a
    direct economic incentive to help whales, right?</p>

    <p>Like [who’s] going to be dumping a bunch of money into helping these
    whales, by either getting them more food or creating safer paths for them to
    go, by creating certain shipping embargoes, so the ships stop killing them?</p>

    <p>Whatever the solution is, based on our current system, there's not a
    visible kickback of like, <em>"the whale is going to pay us a thousand dollars
    every week because it’s alive"</em>; so I think the tricky thing, and why I think
    the framing that I'm leaning towards now myself towards natural systems research, is
    because all of those economic systems in those current lenses of capitalism
    almost always exclude us from being a part of nature, and I think [that’s
    where] we need to shift [our] focus.</p>

    <img src="img/willocean.jpg" alt="ocean turbines">

    <p>Sure, the whale is not paying us because it’s alive (…) but there are
    other byproducts of the systems that we can profit from purely by the fact
    of more whales existing, and by the world being less polluted, [and so] all
    these other systems become cheaper over time, it lowers healthcare costs,
    and all these other things.</p>

    <p>But it's a very hard sale to say that <em>"we need to save the whales so that
    healthcare in 20 years is cheaper"</em>, right? That's not a
    thing we're good at, dealing with based on the current capitalism
    system.</p>

    <p>I think we are starting to see this emerge though in construction, where –
    there's a group in Detroit actually, they have this interesting model where
    they are building wooden structures, and then across from the wooden
    structures they're building a park, that's very densely forested.</p>

    <p>And their thinking is, <em>"when this building is too old, we will knock it
    down, and plant a new forest, and then we will take down the old forest and
    use that to build a new building”</em>.</p>

    <p>And so to me, that's an interesting example of <em>"okay, sure it's not great
    we're cutting down a forest, but I think there's an interesting thing to
    that model where we're getting new forests [being planted], and we're
    realizing there's carbon sequestration there, and there's capital in the
    woods"</em>, and acknowledging that a product of nature has value, which I think
    we're very bad at doing right now, other than dead dinosaurs.</p>

    <p>(...) And so I think, if we can shift that perspective to apply the same value
    to all natural things that could be really beneficial, and I think in my own
    daily life, one of the things that has amazed me lately is that, I'm back in
    San Francisco right now, and one of the strangest and most interesting
    things to me about the city is the fact that it has so many parks along the
    coast.</p>

    <p>So you can go and hike there, and I can take a break, and like just enjoy
    it; but if we look at all those parks systems, they're only there because
    they were all built as defence mechanisms for World War 2. And it's like, if
    that hadn't happened, we may have you know, houses all the way up to the
    edge of the water through the entire city, and no parks.</p>

    <p>To me that's a really funny thing, that you can have such a beautiful
    thing come out of what was one of the worst times in the history of the
    world. And now we have these gorgeous parks that we can enjoy whenever we
    want.</p>

    <h3 class="quote">(…) I want to find the rest of the examples of how these systems can
    become linked, because I think they will have to become linked we want to
    survive.</h3>

    <p>(…) Even at all these big tech companies, it’s quite amazing
    that some of the work as well as they do. I’ve worked at companies where two
    teams have been working on two different projects the same time, and then
    launched them simultaneously in the same week, and not realise the other
    team was working in the same product, because the company is so big.</p>

    <p>Humans are – we're created systems that are too big for us to manage
    effectively, because they’re just so big. And we’ve then applied that same
    issue to the planet, where we have a lot of impact for beings of our size,
    and we don’t know how these systems work, we don’t track them.</p>

    <p>And so, just having a general understanding of systems and systems
    literacy, I think that’s what getting us into this problem (…) we see so
    much of it as being, how do I earn this dollar from this object? <em>(laughs)</em>
    and we don’t think about [the whole] loop.</p>
