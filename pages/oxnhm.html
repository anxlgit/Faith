  <h1>OXNHM</h1>

  <div>
    <p>These are visions from a personal universe.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>1</h2>
    <p>The wise man opened its lips after a millennia in silence.<br>A single boy listened, and immediately hanged himself.</p>
    <p>The tree upon which the boy had found death was revered<br>as a sign from the messiah.</p>
    <p>A thousand temples were built at its feet.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>11</h2>
    <p>The shadows were drawn further. Relief was out of reach.<br>The light was unbearable.<br>The sphere, omnipresently impossible.</p>
    <p>So they prayed, and craved the cleansing of the lands<br>in a sudden drench of violent waters.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>111</h2>
    <p>Storbing lights bathed the valley in subsequent strokes,<br>seeking an answer in the peering eyeholes.</p>
    <p>The molecules, deadly charged with electrical density &mdash;<br>small stones floating in the air, suspended by magnetism.</p>
    <p>A translucid block, floating high over grounds barren,<br>buzzing, shivering, waiting.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>1v</h2>
    <p>The lights fell as in raindrops,<br>bathing the sands in multi-spherical patterns.</p>
    <p>The lines diverged in shapes of perfection,<br>sometimes converging into points at the distance.</p>
    <p>However feeble, the rings echoed their borders,<br>shifting in tune and vibration<br>by the passing of the clouds.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>v</h2>
    <p>She was offered to be immortal &mdash;<br>to transcend the shackles of time, and space,<br>and physical structures.</p>
    <p>She didn't hesitate, but never arrived at an answer.</p>
    <p>The precise moment where she was to accept,<br>so suddenly stretched<br>into eternity.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>v1</h2>
    <p>The sacred artifacts were unearthed after millennia.<br>But of no use: their languages had been lost.</p>
    <p>The gears holding the keys to immortality, power,<br>any and all desires. Their potential, incommensurable,<br>yet untameable.</p>
    <p>All failures deemed them vain. And thus,<br>they were buried anew.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>v11</h2>
    <p>Their origins were undefined.<br>The walls had been set before them,<br>yet they appeared behind.<br>So they were not held.</p>
    <p>They waited,<br>their objectives unknown &mdash; but as we observed them,<br>they seemed to observe back.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>v111</h2>
    <p>As the message came, the pools pulsated.<br>Their waters brimming, conveying the orders.<br>The answers. The psalms.</p>
    <p>The hills were voiceless &mdash; sustained in a moment of prophecy.<br>The lights of stone. The rains like ripples.</p>
    <p>The gathered: occult shapes bending over pools of moonlight.<br>All waiting.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>1x</h2>
    <p>Of all her visions, the best had been the wordless,<br>a voice speaking in obtuse tongues<br>filled with promises of gold and darkness.</p>
    <p>How shad she had been then to be chosen by these divinities,<br>expelled from all pantheons<br>just as she herself had been from her lands.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>x</h2>
    <p>In buried temples, the hidden effigies,<br>old gods: an image of limbs, and eyes, and contrivances.</p>
    <p>Their beliefs usurped by bloated gospels and profaned priests.<br>Their devotion repressed, all prayers effaced.</p>
    <p>Full of silence, their chambers endured still.<br>Their gold shined no longer, and all myths were forgotten.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>x1</h2>
    <p>He then nervously scrambled to find the prism<br>that had produced the screeching noise.<br>Insufferable.</p>
    <p>The object was stone and ore, yet buzzed with magnetic strength.<br>He thought it could be worth an exchange for food.</p>
    <p>Incessantly, a heartbeat pulsated in its vertices.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>x11</h2>
    <p>The city was fire, rains of brilliant smokes <br>breathing death downwards.<br>The air was ash. The streets were dead.</p>
    <p>The ovens, high as towers, tongues of whiteness <br>licking black stones.<br>Their product was pure light.</p>
    <p>Liquid rays slipped into drains.<br>The blinding sky, always illuminated <br>by the gleam coming from the sewers.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>x111</h2>
    <p>Glass emerging from the desert, towers and shrines<br>of gleaming blasphemy and materialism.</p>
    <p>Its shaped shifted, an architecture of white.<br>Lights were said to create impressions of self,<br>its walls a beckoning promise.</p>
    <p>It was the capital. A burnished torch.<br>A most gargantuan siren.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>x1v</h2>
    <p>Some mountains were easily seen, high above,<br>piercing all clouds in unabridged heights.<br>Some were not.</p>
    <p>Some were hidden, sudden, ephemeral.<br>Flowed. Were mistaken. Even dreaded.</p>
    <p>The strayed fell through obsidian fangs &mdash;<br>were encircled, consumed, and vanished forever.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>xv</h2>
    <p>The rhombic prism absorbed all colors<br>into an absolute shadow.</p>
    <p>At sight, it twinkled; even titillated.<br>Its stimulation produced light, and sound, and angry shapes.</p>
    <p>At touch, its surface resembled the creaking of trees.<br>Like infinite forests.</p>
