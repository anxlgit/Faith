                Hi.
                <br/> I'm Anxl.
                <br/> Let's talk about creation.

                First, let me get this out:
                <br/> I'm a nihilist.
                <br/>
                <br/> That doesn't mean I'm pessimistic,
                <br/> nor do I hate the world.
                <br/>
                <br/> It only means I don't find life
                <br/> to have ant inherent pupose.
            </p>

    <section>
        <div class="text">
            <p>
                I find life to be little less
                <br/> than a biological by-product.
                <br/>
                <br/> I think the universe is cold,
                <br/> immense,
                <br/> and mostly dark.
                <br/>
                <br/> I think that we're alone,
                <br/> and have no real reason to exist.

                These thoughts are terrifying. Our brains just can't take the cruelty.
                <br/>
                <br/> And that's why we make execuses.
                <br/> And that's why we make art.

        <div class="text">
            <p>
                Hold up. Let me explain.
                <br/>
                <br/> Through the years, art was deemed worthless,
                <br/> or even worse, a waste of time.
                <br/>
                <br/> But I disagree.
                <br/>
                <br/> I think art has been our best way
                <br/> to fight the chaos of the universe.
            </p>
        </div>
    </section>
    <section>
        <div class="text">
            <p>
                When I speak of art, however,
                <br/> I don't mean it as an exercise,
                <br/> but as a process.
                <br/>
                <br/> And, in the same way,
                <br/> when I speak about creation,
                <br/> I think of it as a theraphy.

                Our lives are small and random,
                <br/> and full of difficult experiences.
                <br/>
                <br/> Our languages, moreover, are limited.
                <br/>
                <br/> Many emotions can't be explained,
                <br/> nor conveyed easily through conversation.

                Take the buzzing heat of evenings
                <br/> in the days of summer.
                <br/>
                <br/> Or the soft murmur of the leaves,
                <br/> falling in silence.
                <br/>
                <br/> Or the stolen kiss
                <br/> of someone whom we deeply love.

                These experiences are central to our lives.
                <br/> They shape our selves.
                <br/>
                <br/> But there's a problem.
                <br/>
                <br/> As social animals, we need to share them.
                <br/>
                <br/> We need to feel we're understood.
                <br/> - to feel we're not alone.

                But how to do this?
                <br/>
                <br/> How to share the un-defined,
                <br/> or un-definable?
                <br/>
                <br/> The best solution, it turns out,
                <br/> is to replicate.
                <br/>
                <br/> To create our own experiences.

                Hence creation.
                <br/>
                <br/> This is my point: that,
                <br/> when we make things,
                <br/> what we're hoping for
                <br/> is understanding.

            <p>
                But there's a problem here as well.
                <br/>
                <br/> No work is unequivocal.
                <br/> All experience is interpreted.
                <br/>
                <br/> And interpretation always falls
                <br/> under personal perspectives.

                Different people come
                <br/> with different backgrounds.
                <br/>
                <br/> Or worldviews. Or ideals.
                <br/>
                <br/> Some will agree with us.
                <br/> Some will not.
                <br/>
                <br/> Some will even hate us.

            <p>
                But worst of all,
                <br/> most won't even care.
                <br/>
                <br/> Of all the people in earth,
                <br/> only a little fraction
                <br/> will even be in the exact position
                <br/> to take a peek at all we do.

                This is why, at first,
                <br/> nobody seems to pay attention.
                <br/>
                <br/> Not because nobody cares,
                <br/> but because we haven't reached
                <br/> the ones that truely would.

                It takes time to get there.
                <br/>
                <br/> The process is messy.
                <br/> Complicated.
                <br/> At times, it will seem possible.
                <br/> Chaotic. Even unjust.

                But do you remember?
                <br/>
                <br/> Our initial fight was just the same:
                <br/> to simplify and understand,
                <br/> a different form of chaos.
                <br/>
                <br/> To fight against the universe. But still a fight, nevertheless.

                In some weird way,
                <br/> the cycle is eternal.
                <br/>
                <br/> The fight is never-ending.
                <br/>
                <br/> And that's just bonkers.
                <br/>

                So my advice would be to make.
                <br/>
                <br/> To stay fighting.
                <br/> To keep creating.
                <br/>
                <br/> And someday,
                <br/> someday will get you.
