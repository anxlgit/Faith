    <h2>Role: Art Installation<br>Year: 2017</h2>
    <p>In 2017, I was selected to take part in Etopia's residence/academy
      for the development of new media art on its giant “Media Façade”.</p>
    <p>During three weeks, we were coached by some of the best in new media art
      and visual coding, in order to develop our own art pieces.</p>
    <p>Mine and a few others were selected to join a recap with best pieces from
      past editions, to be re-scheduled for additional screenings.</p>
